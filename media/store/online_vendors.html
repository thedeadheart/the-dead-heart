<h1>Online Vendors List (v3.1)</h1>

<p>Updates in v3.1 include:-
<ul><li>Updated some URLs
<li>Updated some descriptions
</ul></p>

<p>Updates in v3.0 include:-
<ul><li>Cellophane Square
<li>Global Electronics Music Marketplace
<li>Intergalactic Garage http://www.intrepid.net/igg/
<li>file size bug in Esprit fixed
<li>symbol to indicate CGI database searching</ul></p>
<p>Sites that allow searches of their databases are the most convenient so as to avoid looking through each category. These sites will be indicated by a * after the name of the company (eg. Vinyl Vendors*). Don't let this discourage you if a site does not have searchable content- the Oils are worth a 15 minute browse!</p>

<a name="cs"></a><h3><a href="http://www.cellophane.com">Cellophane Square*</a></h3>
<p>As of right now, Cellophane carries only a basic selection of Oils material, so it is not worth the hassle if you can get the item through a local CD store. However, they have their updays with rare Oils material, so be sure to take a look periodically.</p>
<hr>

<a name="cdb"></a><h3><a href="http://www.cdbanzai.com">CD Banzai*</a></h3>
<p>Someone associated with the band tried to obtain a Japanese release of some Oils material, but the company was not able to supply it. Rumors that Peter purchased bootlegs are no longer rumors - it didn't happen.</p>
<hr>

<a name="cdn"></a><h3><a href="http://cdnow.com">CD Now*</a></h3>
<p>One of the best ways to order over the Internet. Service is extremely reliable, and at last check, they carry the European "Underwater" single.</p>
<hr>

<a name="cdu"></a><h3><a href="http://www.cduniverse.com">CD Universe*</a></h3>
<p>Another great site that also carries the 5 track single. Service takes about a week, and the prices are reliable.</p>
<hr>

<a name="e"></a><h3><a href="http://eil.com/">Esprit</a></h3>
<p>Esprit of all the sites had the most diverse range of hard to find "stuff". At one point, they had the Forgotten Years Oil Can (I don't know if they still carry it.) For large orders, discounts are given. Service time was approximately one week. The catalog is a self extracting .exe file of about 8.5 k, and inflated to a 2 meg text file.<br>
The <a href="esprit.html">Midnight Oil catalogue</a> at Esprit has been incorporated into this ection of The Dead Heart.</p>

<hr>

<a name="gemm"></a><h3><a href="http://www.gemm.com">Global Electronic Music Marketplace*</a></h3>
<p>GEMM is a unique service in that a search of its database shows what it can get from other stores and sites, so not only do you get to find some unique items, but the links that it provides are scores too. As of this version, an autographed D&D cover is available for $200 US. Hmmmmmmm.....</p>
<hr>

<a name="gmw"></a><h3><a href="http://www.musicworld.com.au/">Greg's Music World*</a></h3>
<p>Greg's Music world is probably the cheapest way for non-Aussie fans to obtain the Ghostwriters, Fuzzface, and Hunting Party CD's. GMW is a safe bet, seeing as how most other online vendors would have to order these from Australia anyways.<br>
You can select Oils items on <a href="gregsmw.html">Greg's catalogue</a> directly from The Dead Heart.</p>
<hr>

<a name="ig"></a><h3><a href="http://www.intrepid.net/igg/igg.html">Intergalactic Garage</a></h3>
<p>IG has some used Oils and singles that are worth checking out. There is no way to search the inventory, so be prepared to do some link hopping until you find what you are looking for.</p>
<hr>

<a name="mm"></a><h3><a href="mailto:mojo@mira.net?subject=Midnight Oil">Mojo Music</a></h3>
<p>Colin Clay runs Mojo Music in his free time. The company has no web-site, as it operates mostly through email. Sending Colin your name will get you added to his list mailing lists. When he gets some new stock, he sends details to his lists, and it's a case of emailing him if you see something you want.<br>
Service is fast and reliable. Some nice material comes through this channel, ranging from real rareties (eg. a gold disc) through to old Aussie magazines.</p>
<hr>

<a name="pmb"></a><h3><a href="http:/www.probe.net/~pmb/">Pandora's Music Box</a></h3>
<p>Pandora's Music Box is probably only worthwhile if you're after the Ghostie's or Fuzzface's stuff. They too are pretty safe.</p>
<hr>

<a name="tsn"></a><h3><a href="http://www.tshirtnow.com">T-Shirt Now</a></h3>
<p>T-Shirt Now has some <em>excellent</em> Earth & Sun & Moon shirts for sale. Quality is good, and the art work is.... check it out. I have heard that quantities are limited. Also, the two guys that run the place are very friendly, and take orders over Internet, fax, and phone.</p>
<hr>

<a name="tr"></a><h3><a href="http://www.csmonline.com/tunnel/">Tunnel Records</a></h3>
<p>The infamous Tunnel Records! Certainly you've all stumbled across this site and have dropped your jaw in awe at the number of b**tlegs they have. No comments on the whole issue of boots.  They are probably the most <em>UNRELIABLE</em> company going. People normally receive the products, but sometimes months after the money has been received. Others have gotten their merchandise in a matter of days. There is a lot of "We'll be ready to send it out tomorrow.. (1 week later) We should be all set to send it out tomorrow...." going on when you deal with these people. If you want it, they've got it, but be very cautious with the money handling, and be prepared for long waits.</p>
<hr>

<a name="vv"></a><h3><a href="http://www.vinylvendors.com">Vinyl Vendors*</a></h3>
<p>Vinyl Vendors is my personal favorite. I ordered my Green Disc from them (for those interested- they carry this in and out, check with them once in a while). They have excellent prices, and shipping is about 5-7 days HITS. VV carry most singles in both vinyl and CD format, as well as several different releases of the albums. A paper magazine is also sent to people who have ordered from them.</p>
<hr>

<a name="umsl"></a><p>For those of you with the time and patience (ie, all Oils discs loaded into
the CD changer. :), here is a site to browse through:</p>
<h3><a href="http://ubl.com/store/">The Ultimate Music Store List</a></h3>
<p>This is the largest index of online music stores I have ever seen. Not even I have had the time to look through and rate all of them.</p>

<a name="1"><a href=#top><h2>Golden Age</h2></a>
<pre><b>All the screens are filled with heroes and losers
But the sky's still filled with stars
This junky palace might be on fire
Til the winners lose desire
Let it go let it go

So tell me what you see
Tell me what you hear
If it's the same as me it's the golden age

Big brother tries to stitch and bend
But channel surfers find new friends
See freedom's silhouette increase
Its time to claim that sweet release
Let it go let it go

I can see a purple patch of jacaranda
Framed in eucalypt from this wooden floored verandah
Heading past the watermark
Heading for the hills
Heading for the edge of time
Heading for the thrills of the golden age

Now tell me what you see
And tell me what you hear
If it's the same as me it's the golden age

Now everybody's talking about the golden age

<a name="2"><a href="#top"><h2>Too Much Sunshine</h2></a>
Haven't had so much fun since my daddy took the V8 away
Light a spark in the dark take a mark it's resurrection day
It's a breeze timorese apec speak wear batik seen not heard

Well we do the same things that we always do
Nothing changes but the colour changes hue
I don't come to bury you
The trouble is with you

We got too much sunshine
We got too much sunshine

Have you ever built your house in a town called Pissitaway
You were dreaming of marinas with a crown you were king for a day
Saw a man with a reason any season got a bird in his hand

Well we do the same things that we always do
Nothing changes but the channel changes view
Well the trouble with you has been
You can sleep but you can't dream

We got too much sunshine

(Moginie)

<a name="3"><a href="#top"><h2>Capricornia</h2></a>
Capricornia don't walk away
Show me to the back of your hand
Capricornia don't leave me here
Dying in the back of your land

In the evening things all fall apart
They crawl away dying in the bushes alone
In the morning well I see myself
See myself as a Christ-like figure walking

In the evening things all fall apart
They crawl away 
Drowning in the setting sun
In the morning well I see myself
I see myself as a father mother brother sister

Capricornia don't walk away
Show me to the back of your hand
Capricornia don't fade away
Show me to the back of your hand
Capricornia it's a free ride
Capricornia

(Moginie/Hirst)

<a name="4"><a href=#top><h2>Luritja Way</h2></a>
There's no highway to Luritja way
I listen I listen for it now

There's no turnoff to Luritja way
One moment one moment for me please

I'm reaching out for you across a thousand years
I'm reaching out for you

Joining the dots at Luritja way
There is something hanging in the breeze

Empty space at Luritja way
No richer one picture of discontent

I'm reaching out for you in a valley full of tears
I'm reaching out for you

And I don¹t want to go home
Gasoline junkies dance stoned
It's better than drinking alone

Oh guiding light you will shine you'll pick me up
You'll hold me up
Oh guiding light you will shine
You will shine on me in eternity

Love is bought and sold
Wobbegong tooth of gold
No one gets to get old

I'm reaching out for you cos I still believe in you

(Moginie/Hirst)

<a name="5"><a href="#top"><h2>Tone Poem</h2></a>
Like a heat wave breaking as you smell warm rain
We can fade away or start over again
In a high-five season in a cut-price land
The southern cross don't shine on that invisible hand

Where will you live when the fields are falling
Where will you live when the feedlots calling
Everybody standing in a tree tops saying
Where will you live where will you live
Everybody doesn't have to beg or borrow
We are going to move into a new tomorrow
Where will you live where will you live

Invisible hand clutching at the throat
Statistical sham an emperor's rags its sad
Because equality's the only plea green fields are burning
The reefs on fire and bellies are swollen they're hurting
A willing victim I don't think so
We won't be pinned against the wall
There is no slogan that can feed you

Where will you live when the fields are falling
Where will you live when the feedlots calling
Everybody's standing in a tree tops saying
Where will you live where will you live
Tearing up your ticket for the new titanic
Heat haze refugee no-one panic

Where will we go when the water comes over
Where will you live where will you live
Take a big breath don't have to drown sorrow
Take a deep breath for a new tomorrow

The bow will break the cradle fall
We won't be jammed up against the wall

(Moginie/Garrett)

<a name="6"><a href="#top"><h2>A Crocodile Cries</h2></a>
(instrumental?)

<a name="7"><a href="#top"><h2>Mosquito March</h2></a>
When they march 
When they march over fields
Over fields of green
Walking in the wilderness
No future to the question
You might get a simple answer

Walking in the wilderness
You're naked now just skin and sand
You'll get a simple answer

See the king see the king of happiness
See the king of happiness in the light
The light you can see him crawl
See the king of happiness

Walking in the wilderness
No future to the question
You might get a simple answer

Walking in the wilderness the endless distance
You don't need to get a simple answer

Past the point of no return
You're like a dog without a bone
So get a simple answer
Get a simple answer

(Moginie/Garrett)

<a name="8"><a href="#top"><h2>Been Away Too Long</h2></a>
Fresh air soft landing
So good to be home
This bruised world's got its beauty
It's where I belong

The sight of those green curves
Quickens my heart
Break the grip of Leviathan
Now I'm ready to start

Have I been away too long
Have I been away too long
Have I been away too long
I just can't wait

Saw big smoke umbrella
Blue lights up close
Exploiters of psyche
Stealing the code

I imagine completeness
No spin cycle deceit
Time and tide keep on rolling
Now the worlds at my feet

(Moginie/Garrett)

<a name="9"><a href="#top"><h2>Under The Overpass</h2></a>
Oh the news will travel slowly
Over broken glass
And you've probably heard this story
Under the overpass

Got no time to weep for something
You'll never get back
Are you feeling cold and lonely
Under the overpass

Hallelujah Hallelujah
Under the overpass

Dingo cry in the middle of the night
Snakeskin crawl under desert sunlight
I wish and I hope
Someone's there to drink from the soak
In the town where I hit the ground
In the town with the full nelson sound

Oh the news will travel slowly
Over broken glass
And you've probably heard this story
Under the overpass

Got no time to weep for something
You'll never get back
Are you feeling sad and lonely
Under the overpass

Hallelujah Hallelujah
Under the overpass

(Moginie/Hirst)

<a name="10"><a href="#top"><h2>World That I See</h2></a>
In a country that we call home
In a land that's skin and bone
There's a place that's hardly known

Mountains appearing with the sun
Rivers of light they westward run
Night is draining from the firmament

Railway fettler broken down
On a branch line somewhere south
Off the map and off the world

There is no end to the world that I see
There is no end to the world that I see

As we swing from star to star
We¹re not going very far
The land is hard and gives no quarter

The O'Cannon garrison falls down
You cannot hear the church bell sound
The sun beats down and gives no sanctuary

As sure as I stand on this place
The spirit comes 
Let lightning strike and leave no trace

(Moginie/Hirst)

<a name="11"><a href="#top"><h2>Poets And Slaves</h2></a>
Here comes the mechanical sun
Working on the bones in the dry old creek bed
Mist on the old river bend yellow box hangs like it¹s dead
The emerald silo is rusting from the inside

You want to run like the wind you'll never come here again
You want a world you can save so c'mon you poets and slaves

Circus Olympia pulls into town
The dwarf and the fat man head out for beer
There is no lion that roars to one can stand on the horse
Tomorrow is a no show the fortune teller cries

You want to go down in flames you're gonna crash like the waves
You can't remember your name so come on you poets and slaves

We got everything we need sugar and beef
We got some good ideas
We got the steering wheels and rolling stock too
Clouds came down low on the corn
Meat ants are gathering like storms
Somewhere in the quiet wild darkness a crocodile cries

You gotta you gotta you gotta
C'mon you poets and slaves

You got to arrest the decay you're sinking down in the bay
You can't remember your name c'mon you poets and slaves

You've got to count what you¹ve made
You're gonna pass like the days
Stop time and head for the stage

And c'mon you poets and slaves
C'mon you poets and slaves

(Moginie)

<a name="12"><a href=#top><h2>Say Your Prayers</h2></a>
Don't want to live in a prison cell
Don't want to live in a smoking room
Independence just won't come to you
In the brief of a diplomat

Say your prayers for the future
Say your prayers for the past
It might be round the corner
It might be all we have
Say your Prayers

Don't want to live with a compromise
Don't want to live with hypocrisy
Bureaucracy doesn't have to win
Breaks the cage of the beast within

Say your prayers in the boardroom
Say your prayers on the stairs
It might be catastrophic
It might be too damn bad
Say your prayers

I got the cure for a compassion fatigue
Spend a week with the Timorese
Running scared from the military
You can share you can share your disease

Now we don't live with an absent master
We don't live on an island divided
Don't want my kids to grow up in shame
In a country with a different name
Had to throw them out, had to break the chains

I got the cure for compassion fatigue
Spend a week with the Timorese
Running scared from the military
I come to you
With a plaintive plea.

(Moginie)

<a name="1"><a href=#top><h2>Underwater</h2></a>
<pre><b>Scanning at the blue bended headlands
White flurry scudded, a dark silhouette flashes by, in the wet
It is glistening flesh
In the deep marine, in the deep marine
There is room for make believe out in the ocean
There is room for make believe out on the land
In the wet, in the dream, if its flashing then seen
In the deep marine, in the deep marine

Looking to the white framed headland
Green pockets dropping, a bright cockatoo
Circles up in the breeze, in the realm you can't reach
In the deep marine, in the deep marine
There is room for make believe out in the ocean
There is room for make believe out on the land
In the west, crashes by, its a green silhouette
In the deep marine, in the deep marine

No one can make her, no one can break her down
Underwater, over land
No one can make her, no one can break her
Underwater, over land
No one can make her, no one can break her 
She is what she is and no one can bring her down, bring her down

Looking to the white framed headland
Green pockets dropping a bright cockatoo
Circles up in the breeze, in the realm you can't reach
In the deep marine, in the deep marine
There is room for make believe out in the ocean
There is room for make believe out on the land
In the wet, flashes by, its a green silhouette
In the deep marine, in the deep marine

No one can make her, no one can break her
Underwater, overland
No one can break her, no one can fake her
She it what she is and no one can bring her down, bring her down

Underwater, overland

No one can squeeze her, no one can freeze her now
No one can make her, no one can break her down
No one can seize her, no one can freeze her
She is what she is and you've got to see it

<a name="2"><a href=#top><h2>Surf’s Up Tonight</h2></a>
Wherever the wind blows
When it blows over the sea
The moon’s sitting high
Waves will rise 
Water shapes
Waves will take you, take you there

Surf's up tonight 

Summers on hold
It will go running away
You’ve gotta move now
Get inside
Take that dive
Get inside today

Surf's up tonight
Now I was lonely 
And you were too
I met you down at the waterline

Now there’s something we can do
Now there’s something left to do
Oh yeah

Surf's up tonight

Wherever you are
When you’re coming over land
There’s a place where you can throw it away
There’s a place you can forget
You get wet, it’s free
You get high, you’re alive

Surf’s up tonight
Come on up tonight
Surf’s up tonight

<a name="3"><a href=#top><h2>Common Ground</h2></a>
These are not dispassionate words of the cool
The headline still rules the editor’s a fool
Shall we douse out the flames or will everybody fuse
And leave us stranded here tomorrow
I heard a calling out, a cry from the heart
From the towns of cement and the beauty
A whisper its turned howl, man he didn’t know
He was standing waiting for tomorrow

Nothing’s left, nothing’s found, there must be some common ground

I could never figure the calendars flow
Nor can I work out how the wild, wild wind blows
But we’re ready from within and we’re starting to go
Away from the place of no tomorrow

Nothing’s left, nothing’s found, there must be some common ground
Nothing’s left, (???)   I see there must be some common ground

Oh the wrecking fields are a terrible place 
With a sulphurous smell and a frightening pace
And the Hook goes early and the critic is king 
It’s hard to stay human and stand in the ring 

There’s no time to be absent, a clown or a fool
While Shylock is smiling we’re loaded like mules
If we surrender ourself to industrial rules
We’ll wake up in the wreckage of tomorrow
Now

Nothing’s left, nothing’s found, there must be some common ground
Nothing’s left, something’s found, can we see some common ground

<a name="4"><a href=#top><h2>Time To Heal</h2></a>
In the cities and the towns
The word is coming down
No more doubt, no more pain
There's been a dragging of the chain
Now there's a price we gotta pay
No way out, no way round

Where is the town that we lived in, brother?
Where is the sound of the church bells, sister?
Now is the time to heal

You keep running from the wheel
But there’s nothing left to feel
Empty heart down and out
Now the writer’s can’t explain
Why we’re playing up again
No way out, no way down

Where is the hope of a clean tomorrow?
Hope only offers when justice is coming
Now is the time to heal

Where is the ground, the beloved country?
Women and men who have fallen silent
Where are the words that can speak forgiveness?
Now is the time
Now is the time
Now is the time to heal

<a name="5"><a href=#top><h2>Sins of Omission</h2></a>
On the fringes of torso and lips
Straining to hear the voice of gospel choir
Pummelled plains and beaten fields
We’re never broken in spirit within

But I feel like we’re coming around
Yes, I feel like we’re coming around
Tell me

Cloud burst teeming, insect wave and bite
Yes it’s true, we are not alone
TV silence it’s a narrow entrance
It’s a sometimes leading into future time

But I feel like we’re coming around
Yes, I feel like we’re coming around
I feel like we’re coming around

Sins of omission, no love
Sins of omission

I heard it once before in shepherd’s isolation
Over the horizon in blue and white now, now
Now overcome you can outrun it
When the roarings cease and the right stuff weaves and fits into your life

And I feel like we’re coming around
Yes I feel like I’m coming around, tell me

Sins of omission, no love
Sins

<a name="6"><a href=#top><h2>One Too Many Times</h2></a>
She was the golden summer wine
And now she’s black and blue resigned
He took advantage like the spider, helpless
One too many times

You had to go ahead and sing
You had to steal that diamond ring
Upon the headstone so inscribed, they cried
One too many times

We are so human, we’re so small
We’re always coming back for more
A second helping third and fourth, it’s gone
One too many times
One too many times

<a name="7"><a href=#top><h2>Star of Hope</h2></a>
Hope you’re a God, your turn to pray
Hope you've a God, it's your turn to pray
Light on the hill so far away
The light on the hill is so far away
Boy, where are you now
With skin so brown, get out of town

Star of Hope, star of Glory
Shine upon this half made man
To himself, he begs, steals or borrows
But you won't be seeing him again

Hope you've a God it's your turn to pray
Hope you've a God it's your turn to pray
Light on the hill is so far away
Sign on the hill says it's the judgment day

Howl, where are you now
Words fly around, get out of town

Star of Hope, star of Glory
Shine upon this half made man
Blinded by, a new tomorrow
You wont be seeing him again

Howl, where are you now
Where skin's so brown, get out of town

Star of Hope, star of Glory
Shining on this a frying pan
To yourself if there's some tomorrow
You wont be needing me again

Star of Hope, star of Glory
Shine upon me if you can
To myself, beg, steal and borrow
You wont be seeing me again

<a name="8"><a href=#top><h2>In The Rain</h2></a>
Sorry I am for the hurt I caused
Grieving I still do over careless words
As I move freely to a place
The debris I left behind comes back into my day

Out of time disconnected  
Plagued by senses sweet desire, out of time
Out of time deluded 
I plunged my hand into the mother load of love

In the rain calling out his name, I call, yes I call
In the rain falls on my shame it falls, yes it falls
In the rain

Life picked me up this morning and thrust me to the world
Like a child I’m hurtled forward
Dreaming things anew, sights I see sound true
All the places, open faces gracing everything I view

In the rain falls on my shame I call,yes I call 
In the rain falling on my shame I call yes, I call 
In the rain calling out his name, I fall, yes I fall
In the rain

<a name="9"><a href=#top><h2>Bring on The Change</h2></a>
Here comes the angel of death
You may not remember her yet
Concrete all over her face
Child bride of the human race

Until you see life in the forest
Until you hear you’ve been abolished
Forget everything that you think you’ve been promised
Bring on the change

Sunscreen all over your face
Chatswood wasn’t built in a day
Mysteries are in this game, I say
Shine on, take me away

Heads in the bank, hearts in the closet
Soul’s out to lunch, will soon be upon us
We believe everything that we see, let’s be honest
And bring on the change

Lift up your eyes, look to the heavens
Could be a sign, or a seven-eleven
Some day we’ll see everything they’ve been selling
Bring on the change c’mon, c’mon
Bring on the change, I say
You gotta bring on the change

<a name="10"><a href=#top><h2>Home</h2></a>
There is a place I was born
It is a place I’ve never seen
Don’t even know where it is
Don’t even know my name

Where is home, where is my home?
I’m searching far and wide

It’s a bastard song
It is the feeling that everything’s wrong
We are alive, we that have wings
We have devices can do anything, I say

Where is home, where is my home?
I hear my spirit cry

If you’re out of transmission, way out on the road
If you’re out of commission I can, give you the code
Darkness is coming and it’s in your command
Time to be moving, time

There is a town I was born
Now there’s a place I’ve got to call home

Where is home, where is my home?
I’m searching far and wide, oh yeah
Where is home, where is my home?
I hear my spirit cry
It’s in the clear blue sky

<a name="11"><a href=#top><h2>E-Beat</h2></a>
There is a place we're coming to
It is not green it is not blue
I hope that you understand

The devil was a dancing on the old foreshore
Hitting up on bright lights and the liquor stores
Save me, please save me

We got to prick that bubble in the shopping arcade
Gonna make amends for the things we've said
I do hope that you understand

Dirty washing on the line, footsteps in the sand
Whose gonna lead us on to some promised land
Save me

The devil was a dancing on the old foreshore
Hitting up on bright lights and the liquor stores
Yeah tell me, please save me

The land lives longer if we listen to the earth beat
Lives go forward if we listen to the hearts speak
Seasons won't falter, stars won't fade away
I know

Gonna find myself a place in the country
Wake up and reach out and breathe real air
Do you know how it feels clean tissue no scars

Dirty washing on the line, footsteps in the sand
Whose gonna lead us onto some kind of promised land
Save me 

Devil  was a dancing on the old foreshore
Hitting up on bright lights and the cut price the liquor stores
I say 

The land lives longer if we listen to our hearts speak
Lives go forward if we listen to the earth beat
Seasons won't falter, stars won't fade away
Fade away
They won't fade away

<a name="12"><a href=#top><h2>Barest Degree</h2></a>
I am gone, can't waste more time
I said, not quite joking
The fire has gone the big trees stand
The underground is smoking

Remember nothing you've been told
Means anything to me
And everything you hold is mine
In the barest degree

I walked up to the park
The lion rock was weeping
I walked on to the grave
The lizard king was sleeping

Remember nothing you've been told...

The day's draw long, too long to count
Cushioned by the wasting
Restless age, the rusted temple
A place of my own making

No matter what else you've been told
It's still all up to me
And everything you own, is mine
In the barest degree, in the barest degree

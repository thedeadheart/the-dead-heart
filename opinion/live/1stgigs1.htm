<p>Just out of interest, how about a survey of when our first Oils show was? Should be interesting... Me first!</p>
<p>Oct, 1988, Montreal Forum... I was simply blown away. (especially since I only knew D&D at the time!) Still have the concert on audio tape (Bad quality, with an annoying screaming woman nearby..?!)</p>

<p>My first show was during the 1990 Blue Sky Mining tour, held outdoors at the Memorial Drive Tennis Centre (where Todd Woodbridge has just won the Australian Hardcourt Challenge).<br>
There was an electric atmosphere around the stadium because after the support act Neil Murray and the Rainmakers had played, a thunderstorm rumbled in (ironic eh?). The Oils played a great set while all around us there were flashes from lightning strikes, low rumbles and the constant 
threat of rain. An experience I will always cherish.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>My first was this past Oct. 15/96 at the Warehouse in Toronto (I'm so ashamed) =) If I had known of the previous E&S&M and D&D tours I would have gone....and I would have missed this past fall's one except for the P'Works list....what a great invention, the 'net. And I met a bunch of great people from the list too....please, Todd, no more slick jokes. ;)</p>

<p>1985 or 1986, not exactly sure, at the Dubbo Civic Centre.<br>
I was in year 11 or 12 at school, waited out the back but was too intimidated to approach Peter as he made a dash for the car. It was then, though, that I realised that Jim was my economics teacher's brother-in-law!!</p>

<p>I first saw the Oils on the 12th May 1990 at Wembley Arena in London, supported by Hunters & Collectors. It was part of the world tour promoting BSM. I think they managed to sell out such a large venue on the strength of Beds Are Burning being a reasonable hit the previous year. Thank goodness that since then they have only played smaller venues as Wembley Arena is a
souless aircraft hanger sort of a place, if you're up the back bring your binoculars. Regardless of this I came back with a bad throat and weak legs (from the singing/shouting and dancing; not some sort influenza or something...:)</p>

<p>Summer something-or-other 1985, Albuquerque, NM... Oil opened for UB40... talk about getting blown away by the "support band"!</p>
<p>Then not again until Sept., 1990 in Dallas... missed them TWICE in TX while I was overseas doing fieldwork... started to think I was cursed...</p>

<p>My first Oils show was at the Towson Center, just outside of Baltimore, MD in Towson, MD, 10/4/88. Probably my favorite Oils show ever. It was loud as shit, raw and full of pure energy.</p>

<p>Does going to Wanda beach wondering what all the fanfare is about in 82 count? Great to see rage show some footage of that show numerous times since.</p>
<p>First time going to a show deliberately was the fundraiser for the Illawarra Steelers, 86 (note, I don't think this show appears in Oilbase - although Rob confirmed it was 86 and not 85) at Brandon Park, Wollongong.</p>

<p>The first Oils show I saw was at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago. Talk about a perfect venue! It is an old ballroom that used to be very classy and now is just a bit seedier! It was on the D&D tour in October(?) of '88. I was a mere 18 and had only heard D&D and 10-1 (which I had bought after I had got my concert tickets.) The opening acts were Yothu Yindi (sp?) and a native american indian poet/performance artist whos name escapes me. (He has gone on to a
successful acting career but I still can't remember his name...) Needless to say the the "Ooiills" chants came out during his performance! Us Oils fans are so narrow minded! ;) And Yothu Yindi, what can you say? I'm glad I don't dress like that. I think I'd get cold in winter.</p>

<p>Well the Oils burst on and opened with "Read About It". I still get a heavy adrenalin rush when I hear that opening guitar riff live! It was just so amazing... PG was in fine form. I had never seen anyone sweat/spit/gyrate so much! That concert was just a mind blowing
experience. I had never seen or heard anything like it. Subsequent Oils concerts have been equally amazing but that first one will always be the best because of the great venue and just simply because it blew away all my expectations.</p>

<p>Writing about this has been a great trip down memory lane for me. I've enjoyed reading all the first show memories because I just know how we all felt! We were all amazed beyond belief.<br>
I just wish I was in Oz for the last month!</p>

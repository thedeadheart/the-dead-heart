<h3>Reviewed in <a href="http://www.qonline.co.uk">Q Magazine</a></h3>

<p>This live album-recorded all over Australia between 1982 and 1990-contains no surprises. We are reminded that the band wears its green heart on its sleeve (Garrett keeps making remarks like Who needs a stealth bomber? and Come and stand under this tree); and that it is an incredibly tight live outfit. The harmonies on the wonderful, Byrds-ish Dreamworld are impeccable. Beds Are Burning and Read About It have all the focused '60s verve of the studio versions, if not more. Some of the earlier material, though, is weaker. The title track is probably designed to conjure up the nightmare of industrialisation, but it's a squally din all the same, and right-on-ness will not excuse the flatulent drums and guitar arpeggios of Powderworks. The commitment, though, is palpable and ultimately disarming.</p>

<p>Rating: 2 stars</p>

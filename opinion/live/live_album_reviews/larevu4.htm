<h3>Reviewed in All Music Guide</h3>

<p><i>Scream In Blue Live</i> is, thankfully, a very worthy addition to the group's catalogue. The Oils' music has always had more edge and power in a live setting, and this captures it perfectly. All that's missing is the visual dimension of frantic and imposing front-man Peter Garrett stalking the stage. Great songs that were delivered too tamely in their studio incarnations - "Dreamworld" from <i>Diesel and Dust</i> and "Stars of Warburton" from <i>Blue Sky Mining</i>, for example - erupt in full bloom live from the Brisbane Boondall Centre. Other highlights include "Progress," recorded in 1990 at a protest rally in front of Exxon head offices on 6th Avenue in New York, and a passionate plea for aboriginal rights that serves as introduction to "Beds Are Burning."</p>

<p><em>&quot;Nothing replaces the atmosphere, but if you turn the volume knob to 11, put on a couple of sweaters and jump up and down like a lunatic for a couple of hours, you can get pretty close.&quot;</em></p>

<p>This is the Dead Heart section devoted to one of the most popular aspects of the Oils music - live gigs. Under this section you will find gig reviews, live album reviews, essays on the band playing live, and some set-lists. Much of this work is not my writing, and so I wish to thank everyone who has ever touched a keyboard to write a word on the band!</p>

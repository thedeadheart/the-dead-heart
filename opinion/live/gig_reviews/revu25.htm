<h1>Oils Gig Reviews</h1><h3>The Bridgeway, (Aus), Feb 1998</h3>
<HR>

<p>You can all breathe a sigh of relief now. The Oils show in Adelaide last night was nothing short of awesome!! The band played with more energy than I have ever seen before. A description the gig follows.</p>

<p>Finiscad were the support act and they rocked. They played a good up tempo set that lasted about 40 minutes. The only problem was that the mix sucked and they were way to loud.</p>

<p>Only a short while after the lights went down and the 'RSL' stage was revealed. They had the LED signs and the Casino music going for about 7-8 minutes whilst a drum technician was sorting out some glitches with Rob's Drumkit (Good job, cos Rob was back with vengeance). Rob's kit was back to it's full size best with the twin bass drums and galvanised bin lids.</p>

<p>The oils eventually burst out and did a blazing version of 'Only the Strong'. There was copious usage of the wheel, and 3 members of the audience were asked to spin it for the band. The wheel was spun four times, and three of the songs that came up were Dreamworld, My Country and Read About It. </p>

<p>The fourth song was a song off Redneck Wonderland called Free My Soul. This song was loud and heavy duty, we're talking Stand in Line proportions here. They also played 3 other songs off of the forthcoming album. What Goes On was one but I can't remember the names of the other two. (perhaps Steve Brown or Andrew Wundke can help out here?) All's I can say is that they were bruisers and It sounds as if the new album is going to be one to use to annoy your neighbors.</p>

<p>
Other songs that were played were:-
<ul>
<LI>No Reaction (Awesome!!!!!!!!!)
<LI>E-beat
<LI>Shakers and Movers
<LI>Back on the Borderline
<LI>Power and the Passion (Amazing Drum solo from Rob)
<LI>Renaissance Man 
<LI>US Forces
<LI>The Dead Heart
</ul></p>

<p>I didn't get a set list so again maybe Steve or Andrew can fill in the rest of the songs.</p>

<p>Other highlights of the night were:-<br>
At the end of Power and the Passion, Rob hung from one of the Rafters and stomped on one of the bin lids with his feet repeatedly. He also sent his usual 50 or so drum sticks flying</p>

<p>Peter had plenty to say about a few local issues such as the proposed Uranium mine  and Nuclear waste site currently in the papers here. He also noted at the start of the show that "this is genuine Australian Rock's finest hour". He wasn't lying!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Here's to my tinnitus</p>

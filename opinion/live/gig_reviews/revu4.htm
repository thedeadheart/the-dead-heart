<h1>Oils Gig Reviews</h1><h3>San Franciso - 1993</h3>
<HR>
Some bands are perfect in the recording studio. Some bands made wonderful albums that are so
radio-friendly they might as well have a stamp on them that says "DJ approved."<br>
Midnight Oil is not one of those bands.<br>
Some bands, however, are born to be live. Some bands get on stage with such ferocious energy and passionate musicianship that whatever flaws might exist in their music are simply overwhelmed by the power of the performance.<br>
Midnight Oil is one of those bands.<p>
The Australian quintet (with an extra keyboard player) devastated the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium Wednesday with an absolutely spectacular 90 minutes of all-out rock and roll -- but
due to their lack of radio hits, the hall was less than two-thirds full. That hardly mattered to those who were there, or Midnight Oil, as the band roared through a set drawn from throughout its career, culminating in a nuclear version of "Beds Are Burning" that was one of the single most riveting performances of the year.<p>
Naturally, all eyes focus on 6-5, shaven-head singer Peter Garrett, and for good reason, but the rest of the band deserves more than casual mention. Garrett's charisma, unorthodox but
compelling dancing and fiery delivery are hard to ignore, but he is backed by a band that is every bit as talented, if not more so, than he is. Drummer Rob Hirst, who writes many of the songs, is a rock, and bassist Bones Hillman completes a rhythm section that simply never wavers. Guitarist Martin Rotsey is excellent, and guitarist/keyboardist Jim Moginie is too. There are no weak spots in Midnight Oil's lineup, and when the band rolls out the hits as
it did Wednesday (only two songs from the new album), the result is sheer frenzy.<p>
Midnight Oil may never match the sales of "Diesel and Dust", the 1987 album that contains their biggest radio hits ("Beds Are Burning" and "Warekura"), but anyone who sees them live couldn't really care less. I've seen them three times now, and twice they have put on one of the most memorable shows of the year. I won't miss them next time, and neither should you.<p>

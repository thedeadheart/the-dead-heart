<h1>Oils Gig Reviews</h1><h3>Queensland Performing Arts Centre, Brisbane, 17th August 2000</h3>
<HR>

<p>Such was the hushed atmosphere in the QPAC Concert Hall that one couldn't help but wonder whether half the audience had been expecting to see the "Sound of Music" which was playing next door.</p>

<p>Melbourne support trio (quartet on the night) Oscarlima hit the stage to almost total silence, and each song showcased from their recently released Desert Caravan LP was greeted with very such nervous applause, as if to make too much noice would bring the walls themselves crashing down.</p>

<p>Loud noise of course is what Midnight Oil is all about, and from the luxurious comfort of the Concert Hall seating, staring at the Organ Pipes spiraling up to the high ceilings, with a welcome uninterrupted view of the stage, the Oils launch into Spirit of the Age.</p>

<p>With all 5 band members on the "front line" the acoustically driven versions of Short Memory and Tell me the Truth were faithful to the Real Thing whereas Jim Moginie showcased his acoustic guitar wizardry on the verses of Warakurna. Last of the Diggers brought a shortlived lukewarm reaction as the momentum was carried on with the old favourites Blue Sky Mine and Beds Are Burning.</p>

<p>With Rob Hirst back in his rightful place behind the full drum kit the volumn went up a notch with Say your Prayers, The Real Thing and by the time the last strains of King of the Mountain had faded away a good portion of the audience were dancing in the side aisles and the rest no doubt were blissfully unaware of their stoid surroundings.</p>

<p>The evenings highlight (which was again to be on display at the Alexander Hills Hotel gig a fortnight later) was Moginie's guitar solo on No Time for Games. If there is a better guitarist in Australia today it would be a treat to hear them, Redneck Wonderland brought the curtain down on the main section of the show after things had taken a further acoustic turn with US Forces and The Dead Heart.</p>

<p>With rumours rife that the Real Thing will be the Oils last studio Album with Sony, Garrett gave all fans a little hint for the Oils future direction. As bassist Bones Hillman took shots of the crowd on his digital camera for their website Garrett confirmed that even the Oils were "rushing headlong" into the digital age "with one finger on the tab key".</p>

<p>For the encore, Garretts heartfelt In the Valley, followed by Power and the Passion and Read About It ensured that the concert didn't finish with anyone in their seats.</p>

<p>A special mention must go the gentlemen in the audience who have unwittingly designed the country a new national flag - with one of the Aussie stars being replaced by the Powderworks "Hand" logo.</p>

<p>Peter Garrett in charge of the new Republic anyone?<br>

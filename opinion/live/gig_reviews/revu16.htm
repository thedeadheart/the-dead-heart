<h1>Oils Gig Reviews</h1><h3>Corner Hotel, Melbourne - 20th Nov. 97</h3>
<HR>

Workers here's a story about the Oils gig I saw last night at the Corner Hotel Richmond.<p>

After securing a spot at the very front stage left, my mate and I settled in for an Oils experience. We were right in front of Jim and I was amazed at how many effects pedals he had I counted 22 of them.<p>

The stage was decorated in a mini RSL type theme, for the non Aussies this translates to a couple of poker machines on stage with tacky flashing lights etc.  There was one of those LED matrix sign things flashing up U2 style subliminal messages like "a friend is somebody you
trust" and lot's of of deep and meaningful slogans. This was the kind of sign you might see displaying in a pub when your meal order is ready or flashing up Bingo numbers. Anyway being a Victorian I could really relate to the gaming venue surroundings and the "Are You Being Jeffed? messages on the sign (Jeff being the premier of Victoria famous for his shonky deals with his Casino operating mates)<p>

Anyway, Pete and the boys hit the stage and launched into a new song "Haulaway" quickly followed by "Power and The Passion". Pete then unveiled a spinning wheel complete with 65 song titles on it, he explained that as there were only 3 different types of venue they could
play at these days in Victoria, IE, the Casino, a Cappuccino Bar or a live a sweaty in your face venue, he thought they'd adapt things a bit.<p>

During the set the wheel was spun and whatever came up was played (well almost).  I dipped out on getting a set list but here's some of the more obscure songs that spun up on the wheel...<p>

Powderworks<br>
Maralinga<br>
Wedding Cake Island<br>
We Live in a Political World -(Bob Dylan)<p>

There was also a loose set list used as well. A few new songs including "Blot", White Skin, Black Heart and Wot Goes On were played and went down well. The new ones are definitely something a bit different and much more heavier and industrial?. I'm not real flash with describing music but I can say that after a few listens the new stuff kicks arse.<p>

The guys all seemed to be enjoying themselves, I saw Bones just before he went on stage fooling around with the T Shirt he had on.  The Shirt had "BASS PLAYER" and some smaller writing on it and he was covering up the B in BASS and amusing some of the roadies.  Peter was wearing his usual obscure T-Shirt this one had a picture of a Tee Pee? and the words ANU.......CH  something it looked like something to do with North American Indians.<p>

All in all it was a great night and about the 50th time I've seen the Oils.  I'll be there again tonight and I'm sure the spinning wheel set list selector will pull a few more old ones out of the box.<p>

<h1>Oils Gig Reviews</h1><h3>Melbourne - 22nd Nov. 97</h3>
<HR>

My turn to report on a gig and as I was at the Regent last night I'll do that.<p>
The first thing was that the crowd seemed older then I've ever seen before, probably due to the venue and the all ages format. The place was full all the way with around 3'000+ in all (by my estimate).<p>
The Whitlams (?) the support band was the first I've seen that wasn't abused by the crowd, I think this was due to the older nature of the crowd, although they were quite good (but a very different style).<p>
The Oil's opened with "What goes on" (I don't think anyone has mentioned this but more or less following the listing on 20'000w RSL at each concert). They completely went off, playing faster and harder then I've ever heard them before. The highlights of the night would have been, Bed's, King of TM (played at about twice the cd speed), cemetery (I've still got this 
stuck in my head, can anyone get the full lyrics?) and best of both worlds.<p>
The crowed loved it all, but we were fucked around by the management who only let people in the front row into the mosh pit (so absolutely nothing happened down there).<p>
Garrett talked about the death of MH, and they all seemed quite upset by it.<p>

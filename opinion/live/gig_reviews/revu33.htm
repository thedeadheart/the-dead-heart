<h1>Oils Gig Reviews</h1><h3>Metro, Brisbane, 5th July 1998</h3>
<HR>

<p>Preceded by a surf movie, acoustic pub rock band Pale Riders and redneck jokes from MC Steady Eddie, <B>Midnight Oil's</B> performance is divided into two parts. First comes a greatest hits set, the contents of which is determined by a spinning wheel with song titles written on it - and boy have they got some hits! 'Blue Sky Mine' sets the tone for the night; 'My Country' stirs hearts and voices. Luck sends 'Hercules' our way, along with 'US Forces' and 'Forgotten Years'.</p>

<p>Then, with a wardrobe change (from black to red), it's on with songs from the Oils' new album. Just as <em>Redneck Wonderland</em> is proving to be a better record with every listen, its songs sound <em>really</em> good live. It possesses a harder edge than <em>Breathe</em>, which works well because the Oils are still a hard-rockin' live band. But despite their heavier reliance on electronics, their songs retain an organic feel - which, in turn, lends their message more import.</p>

<p>Peter Garrett - with his legendary gyrations - is still unquestionably one of the most striking frontmen of our time. His capacity for expressing righteous rage consistently for such a long time is nothing short of extraordinary, although he crosses the line into hectoring a few times too often. Still, you have to admire his tenacity: while he's got breath in his body and there's something to be angry about, he'll be on a podium somewhere.</p>

<p>Jim Moginie brings an edgy pop feel to 'Safety Chain Blues' and 'Drop In The Ocean', with his repetitive key riffs. Rob Hirst and Martin Rotsey really let loose on 'Redneck Wonderland'. And the inimitable Bones Hillman and his bass are a focus point throughout.</p>

<p>A revitalised version of 'Power And The Passion' is the perfect finale - after two decades, it still best sums up what this band is about.</p>

<h1>Oils Gig Reviews</h1><h3>?, January 1998</h3>
<HR>

<p>Prologue:
With a packed lunch/dinner (that being breakfast bars, breakfast bars & more breakfast bars), an esky full of drinks, compass & map we (Krusty, Kylie & Sandy) thought we were ready for the Tumbi Umbi experience. But with no pants, no ID & no idea, we almost missed out on the gig. We were lucky to make it as far as Jimmy's place with Sandy deciding he wanted to take a detour off the main highway to Gosford. It would have been OK if the detour had been planned. How did you not realise you were turning off a major 4-lane highway Sandy? Finally arriving at Jimmy's place for directions to Mingara, we then realised Krusty only had the dodgy torn shorts she was wearing (jeans still in the dryer at home), Kylie had no ID (also left at Krusty's place), and Sandy wants to point out that he forgot nothing but his sense of direction. (Peter also forgot his hat, but more about that later)</p>

<p>Luck being with us, Krusty somehow got in with the shorts (with a few disapproving looks
from the staff), Kylie had a few more problems proving her age (which Krusty couldn't understand - "26 is ancient: old enough for a pension card & retirement home isn't it?" - & I couldn't understand either: I haven't been asked for ID in years!) Thankfully the "Team Leader" (what sort of position title is that?) decided I looked sufficiently over 18
& let us all in.</p>

<p>Sandy strode ahead valiantly to nab those front row positions, which we then guarded from those wild Central Coasters - Not! It was actually a very mild crowd. Very! Which was nice for Krusty & Kylie who are still recovering from the Manly scrum, with bruises on every part of the body that comes into contact with the front barrier.</p>


<p>Chapter One:
Skunkhour came on & played a very short set & the Oils were on by 9.30. They opened by spinning the wheel & breaking into Best of Both Worlds. In fact, most of the night's set list was comprised of wheel spinning. And of course the wheel never lies, which must mean that Garrett needs a heavy duty set of glasses - perhaps a telescope would help him. It seems that he can't figure out what's written on the wheel an arms length away, but we can read it from a stage length away. Poor Marty was wandering the stage looking totally bewildered as he read the wheel ("Tell me the Truth") & prepared to put the capo on his guitar, when Garrett burst into "Underwater". And Peter Garrett IS the Tim Fischer of the entertainment world, even if he didn't bring his funky bush hat. As for Jim, he apparently has a new toy to play with on the stage. We had great expectations for this new toy. Sadly, we were devastated!!!! when Jimmy did not pull it off. It all happened during Power & the Passion. Rob led us into what was meant to be Jim's showcase of modern technology: we had that fantastic drumming solo, then.........nothing. We waited....and waited.........Jim assures us that it will all be
happening tonight. "It will be big, really big". OK Jimmy, we'll be waiting for it!</p>

<p>Our big discovery of the night was that Bones does not like eating vegemite rolls on stage. Jimmy lobbed the roll at his feet. Bones picked it up eagerly & opened it up to see what was inside. You should have seen the look of horror on his face (is it true that only those born in Australia can appreciate the wonder of vegemite?). But perhaps he appreciated the thought, coz he threw some bottled water in our direction.</p>

<p>Now for the important information: the font on the set lists has changed yet again (actually if Krusty & I had gotten around to writing our reviews of Manly & Parramatta before this, you would have heard this world-breaking news earlier). Obviously an executive decision has been made & we believe the font they now use is Arial. Unfortunately the printer they are using is of a sub-standard quality - the print runs when it gets wet!!!! Shocking isn't it! At least last night's set list was in a dark print to begin with. I don't know how the band could have
read the setlists of previous nights, it was so faint (especially Peter, how did you manage?)</p>


<p>Epilogue:
After the gig, Krusty, Sandy, Jimmy, Matt & Kylie waited around the back entrance. Unfortunately Rob & Bones made a quick getaway before anyone reached the back doors. However, Jim, Martin & Peter came our for a chat. In our "exclusive interview" with Martin & Jim, we quizzed them about the release date of Redneck Wonderland. Martin's response: "Isn't it out already?" But of course, we know that if it hasn't been mentioned on powderworks, then it hasn't happened. Right???</p>

<p>Peter was in a jovial mood, although rather taken aback by the number of security guys with their trusty security dog (which of course wasn't as pretty as Krusty's doberman, Archie - who, by the way, has his own webpage) hanging around the back doors to ward off his wild &
uncontrollable (????) fans - not! One tough security guy even told us to queue up & counted out each of us a number (like, there were only about 10 of us, we were hardly going to mob Pete!). Peter's shock of the night was to be called a hairless Bon Jovi. To have had a camera
for that split second reaction. Now I ask anyone who has seen the T-shirts from one of the recent Bon Jovi tours (it was November '95 in Melbourne, anyway), doesn't the 20,000Watts CD cover & t-shirt just look so similar? When I first saw cover of the latest Oils album, my
immediate comment to Krusty was: that's the Bon Jovi picture. To explain, there's Bon Jovi in the middle foreground & the other band members either side in the background - did the Oils know this was not an original idea when their photographer lined them up??? Poor sods. So I had to tell Peter, their picture made it look like a hairless Bon Jovi T-shirt. This was important information, just so they know to change their design for Redneck Wonderland.</p>

<p>Anyway, the set list is underneath. Oh, by the way, we forgot to mention: yes it was a great gig, had lots of fun, blah, blah, blah. Oh & if you go to a gig soon, be sure to notice the LED displays hanging from above. Someone has put lots of effort into the messages going up
on it; real flashy stuff! </p>

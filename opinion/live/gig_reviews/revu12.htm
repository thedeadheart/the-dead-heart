<h1>Oils Gig Reviews</h1>
<h3>Rockhampton</h3>

<HR>

<p>Hi Powderworkers.<br>
Rockhampton concert - Wednesday night - rating 9 out of 10
Better than the Breathe tour but not as good as Saturday night in Brisbane. Venue-sucked-sucked-sucked-sucked-sucked, all 700 people in a room big enough to hold 400.</p>

<p>The signs were ominous when Peter's drink supply included 6 cups of Staminade, 8 cups of water, a large bottle of water and a packet of salt tablets. Jim, Bones and Martin all had similar amounts at the ready. But we didn't care because we were at the front directly in front of Peter, one metre away. The guys behind me tried to guess his attire but I blue them out when I got it exactly right, after all I'd only just seen him on Saturday. Just for the record Black long sleeve shirt with stripes and track suit pants.</p>

<p>The lights dimmed, the crowd went wild and out they came.<br>
WOT GOES ON<br>
UNDERWATER<br>
KING OF THE MOUNTAIN ( my mobile wouldn't work in this venue )<br>
PROGRESS<br>
All done to perfection, what a night this would be. Peter then had a brief chat about keeping promises. Last time he was suppose to play in Rockhampton he got food poisoning but promised to return. This was just before the Breathe tour.</p>

<p>HAUL AWAY<br>
WHITE SKIN BLACK HEART<br>

The bouncers were now handing out cups of water to the first 3 rows but the band kept playing<br>
WHEN THE GENERALS TALK<br>
SINS OF OMISSION<br>

DEAD HEART<br>
DREAMWORLD after his famous Keith Williams talk<br>
BLUE SKY MINING<br>

ENCORE ENCORE the crowd cheered and the famous Oils chant went up. Five minutes later they reappeared<br>
SURFS UP TONIGHT<br>
BEDS ARE BURNING<br>
FORGOTTEN YEARS<br>
Peter really encouraged the crowd to sing along to alot of the songs through the night. Not enough drumsticks thrown by Hirsty, I just missed one!! Jim's guitar sounded much better than Brisbane. Skunkhour sat down beside the stage and sang along abit. Peter was looking over and smiling alot, it seemed that these two bands are getting on great which will be benificial to both bands. Skunkhour's exposure all around Australia and beyond,and the Oils having a top class support act.</p>

<p>Lights on, all fluids drunk and gear being packed away all too soon. Are well there is always the promo posters to collect off the bouncers that we had prearranged Bummer some blonde bimbo sucked up and got our posters. Boy were we pissed off, but at least we managed to get both Skunkhour's and Midnight Oils set list off the stage. My mate mitch swapped his set list for bone's word list for underwater. Gee he doesn't get to sing much if he has to write it down. Instant relief when we hit outside but we required a change of shirt for the drive home. Luckily though I managed to get a Green breathe shirt with the fish on the back and Midnight oil on the front left breast  ( close to the heart ) Has anybody seen this shirt before?????</p>

<p>Not bad though 12:35 finish although that also meant it was 2am when we got home. Thats not too bad until you start work at 7.</p>

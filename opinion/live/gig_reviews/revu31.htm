<h1>Oils Gig Reviews</h1><h3>Mercury Lounge, New York, 7th December 1997</h3>
<HR>
Although it's been about 6 years since I last saw Midnight Oil, I have to say they are the best live band I've ever seen and I've seen many. Playing in a small club with the best sound system in the city only made the show that much more impressive. The energy of the band and the presence of Peter Garrett could make you never want to see another band besides Midnight Oil live.....nothing can compare. The show was basically a greatest hits-fest (their greatest hits album just came out). They played songs from 1984 through 1997 and didn't disappoint on any of them. To everyone who has never seen them...you have no idea what you are missing.

<h1>Oils Gig Reviews</h1><h3>Walt Disney World, Florida, 10th Dec 1997</h3>
<HR>

<p>If all you needed was a point of view and a soapbox to stand on, Al Gore could be a pop star. One frequently overlooked aspect of Midnight Oil is that they have much more to offer than mere words; amid their PC rants about the environment, Aboriginal rights, and corporate greed, these Bruces write great melodies, massive hooks, and anthemic choruses that are well worth shouting along to.</p>

<p>"You're witnessing a new era of the band," drummer Rob Hirst confided before the show, leaving a pregnant pause before adding with a grimace, "the Oils at Wallyworld." And indeed, it was quite the anomaly - the Aussie eco-warriors proselytizing in the middle of a giant playground built on a drained wetland (just the sort of thing that would normally get their dander up). Yet the group made the best of it, preaching to the unconverted and blazing through an hour of furious guitar rock.</p>

<p>Truth be told, the Oils weren't at their absolute best. The poor blokes were suffering from colds, jet lag, and the general fatigue earned on a quick promotional tour for their latest release, the career-spanning retrospective <em>20,000 Watt R.S.L.</em> But they made the best of it, playing a judicious mix of fan favorites including "King of the Mountain," "The Dead Heart," and "Power and the Passion," longstanding set anchors like "U.S. Forces," and one new composition, "What Goes On." That song, with its caustic techno sheen may signal a brave new direction for the Oils, who need to stay current in order to earn slots on playlists now dominated by Nine Inch Nails and Prodigy. Not to worry, though: Despite the digital rattle and hum, the track is still characteristic of the band's astute observational songwriting.</p>

<p>Throughout the show, singer Peter Garret (he of the large, skeletal frame, shaved head, and daunting glower) flailed his arms for emphasis as he spat out pleas for peace, love, and understanding. The band, led by the chiming guitar and keyboard work of Jim Moginie and Hirst's thrashing drums, stayed right with him. And while the energy level may have flagged on "My Country" and "Surf's Up Tonight," things kicked in nicely during a relentless, driving version of "Forgotten Years" and continued on through "Truganini," "Blue Sky Mine," "I Don't Want to Be the One," and an encore of "Beds Are Burning" and "What I Need."</p>

<p>Maybe it was the fatigue, their Mickey Mouse surroundings, or too many hours of listening to American talk radio (a subject Garrett addressed several times during the show), but the Oils had a bit of an off night. Still, good lads that they are, they gave it their best shot, which on a rainy Florida evening was better than the distracted and disinterested crowd deserved.</p>

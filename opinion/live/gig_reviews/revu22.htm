<h1>Oils Gig Reviews</h1><h3>Manhattan Hotel, Ringwood (Aus), 21st Feb 1998</h3>

<HR>

<p>Well, this one wasnt as packed as others I've been to, which is good in a way, but the concert was as good as ever. The 'Oils' chant had its way again and forced the support band off the stage, who I didnt really think much of. All's well though when our favourite bald guy and the rest of his gang comes out on stage and struts their stuff. Many thanks to Rob who showed off his manly bod to all half way through by taking his shirt off. (Rob - next time throw one of your sticks my way =) ). Anyway, great night all up. Here's the list as best as I can remember, if anyone has any changes to the order or and addition/subtraction/modification of a song, please tell me because I want the full list.</p>

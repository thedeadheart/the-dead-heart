<p>Just to add a bit more from Stephen. The band started with Cool Change,the next song I can't remember hearing before (may have been new) Third song of the night was definitely King of the Mountain!!!!!! I know this for sure because I rang my mate Tim in Gladstone on the old Mobile Phone during the song and let him have a listen. Boy was he pissed off he was at home watching a funeral on T.V. Can't remember too much of the order after that as I was too busy singing and dancing but boy didn't the red and white top hats stand out in the crowd!!!!! I just hope Peter remembers them when he sees them again in Rockhampton on Wednesday night.</p>

<p>Was disappointed to see peter come out in a plain black long sleeve t-shirt Rob had a great attempt at smashing the pigskins to oblivion. My position was a little better than Stephens. the Riverstage had a flat area about 15m in width full of crowd surfers etc. jumping around and not seeing too  much but then the ground banks up away from the stage at enough of an angle that the person in front doesn't get in the way. I was in the sixth row on this bank probably no more than 20m from the stage with an uninterupted view from their ankles up of the  whole show. Robs attempts at ricochetting the drum sticks into the crowd off the cymbals didn't work real well as there was a bit of a gap in front of the stage and a shit load of security guards to stop the surfers making it to the stage (I counted 18 before they came on).</p>

<p>I don't think Peter will be on Keith Williams christmas card list after his small introduction to Dreamworld (developer of the Hinchenbrook Passage resort) After a couple of breaks to chat it seemed way to early to hear  Your a great crowd Good Night and only an hour and a bit on stage. Encore!!! Encore!!!!!! I heard the crowd cheer. Beds are Burning heralded the return of the messiah along with three other great tracks and a change of clothes. Out came the WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE shirt and hirsty had to change his shirt as well, probably from heaps of sweat At the end of these songs a rather distressed looking Peter signalled to the band and the side desk that he was finished, he couldn't go on. Encore!!! Encore!!! the crowd cheared and only about 20 minutes on stage.</p>

<p>A rather Humble Peter reappeared with the band and thanked the crowd for their attendance. Then probably the best rendition of Hercules you would ever have heard was played. Overall a very strong, powerful and loud concert. Rating it - probably a 11 out of 10. Including the breaks about an hour and three quarters of pure heaven</p>

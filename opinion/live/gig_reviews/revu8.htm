<h1>Oils Gig Reviews</h1><h3>Brazil 97</h3>
<HR>
Those who have never seen Peter's performance live, don´t know what they are missing...  Can you imagine a man, as tall as himself, dancing like a marionet or surfing on the stage? They are great... play feeling the music is comming out to us... The show took about 1 hour and a half and everybody missed two songs: "Bedlam Bridge" and "Put Down That Weapon".<p>
Ah, something strange happend when they finished "Earth and Sun and Moon" (the last one) They seemed like something had scared them... they were in a hurry to go out...<p>
Despite that, some famous songs were<br>
_ King of the mountain (the first song)<br>
_ Warakurna<br>
_ Surf´s up tonight<br>
_ Sins of omission<br>
_ Underwater<br>
_ Dreamword<br>
_ One Country (yes, they played)<br>
_ Forgotten years (the best, I guess)<p>
Something I didn't like was the excess of security guys around the Oils...  They must think we are predators or something like it... not even Iron Maiden put too many security in the backstage...We'd talked to them for about 40 minutes and the black-dressed were 10 meters distant. All I said can make it seem like I didn't like the show. But I liked it a lot (everybody did...) It was one of the best I´ve ever had and I´ll tell to everyone who wasn´t there: YOU MISSED ONE GREAT NIGHT IN YOUR LIFE!!!

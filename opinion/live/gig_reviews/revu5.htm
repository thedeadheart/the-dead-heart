<h1>Oils Gig Reviews</h1><h3>The Forum, London - 29 October 1996</h3>
<HR>
‘The raising of children\The rearing of young\Used to be simple\Look whats it become’. Peter Garrett’s considerable frame emerges from the darkness as the Oils launch into ‘No time for Games’. The boys are in town to ‘see some friends’ and from the opening chords its obvious that they are here to enjoy themselves, the opening track being the first of many surprises in a set that also showcased 8 songs from their latest offering Breathe.<p>
Next into ‘My Country’, and the Forum erupts as it does for other recent favourites, ‘Dreamworld’ and the singalong ‘Forgotten Years’. But its the choice of songs and Garretts humorous dialogue with the crowd that is the lasting impression of this gig. A chap from the front row guests on guitar for ‘Sell my soul’, Jim Moginie leads a charge through some back catalogue with ‘Pictures’ (when was the last time they played this ?) and ‘Hercules’, both tracks from the excellent 1985 EP Species Deceases, and then indulges an audience request in the form of ‘US Forces’ which formed part of the encore.<p>
A low key rendition of ‘The Dead Heart’ sees Garrett handing over to the audience (a moving kareoke if ever there was one) and yet still proved he was human by making a complete mess of ‘One too many times’ (on guitar).<p>
With the exception of the excellent ‘Bring on the change’ there was a hesitancy in the delivery of the new material, although probably due in part to the audiences’ own unfamiliarity with the material. No doubt ‘Sins of Ommission’, ‘Star of Hope’ and the single ‘Underwater’ will become live stables in the future.<p>
Over the years Midnight Oil have never had a particularly easy relationship with (or any sort of regard for)  politics or the press and again there weren’t many that escaped the Garrett treatment. This time though it was less rant and more humerous insult, John Major (the ‘boring old fart’) and Bill Clinton (the ‘Gutless Wonder’) being the undisputed highlights. Somewhere in there was a feverish ‘Tell me the truth’ taking a less than subtle dig at Rupert Murdoch and co.<p>
As previously mentioned it was a night of surprises and the highlight of the show was quite simply a delight. With Garrett leaning on a keyboard  stage right the consistently brillient (yet undeniably enigmatic) Jim Moginie took control on ‘Outside World’’ creating the haunting, pulsing chords that set the swirling synthesizer tones of 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1. It was a magnificent performance.<p>
A couple of rip roaring encores later (‘Sometimes’ the standout track) and the Oils depart with as little fuss as they appeared, leaving a sweat soaked audience gaping (as usual) in awe of what they have just witnessed. Its often quoted that you ‘don’t just like the Oils you Live them’. With gigs like this it isn’t hard to see why.<p>

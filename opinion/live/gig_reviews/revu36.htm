<h1>Oils Gig Reviews</h1><h3>, ,   19</h3>

<p>Peter was more intense last night. I think the whole band was actually. The sound was great, and they were nearly flawless. To set things up better as I wasn't so detailed on Tuesday, this is how the stage is set.</p>

<p>Steady Eddie introduces the first set as the "classics". This has 5 slot machines at the back of the stage, and the "chocolate wheel". Of course the readerboard is up (didn't work half the time last night) and Rob has a large barrel with a hand painted outline of Australia with Redneck Wonderland painted across it. This should be close enough for Jeff & Josh as he does hammer it in the "Industrial Disco" version of P&P!</p>

<p>The wheel was spun twice and the first was Surfing with a Spoon, cool, and the second was When The Generals Talk, cool again. The second spin landed on Truganini and he said something about it being on the list and spun again, it was never played so I do not know what was up with that.</p>

<p>This is the time Peter chooses to rant usually. He starts it off by describing the stage and how this is what Australia has become, a gambling society, it's main source of income. (OK Pete relax, don't forget the greedy "companeeza"). But it is to make a point. He says people are to busy watching the Footy (hey) show and hanging out at the RSL's with pokies etc..</p>

<p>He described two of the machines of which I only remember one where he called it the BHP machine (steel company who lost millions this year), "totally worthless" he called it. "These are special machines, they are free" he screams. He then moves on to the wheel and calls it the Tim Fisher wheel. I apologise as I have not taken the time to find out who that is. He got pretty adamant next and I forgot the exact words but he said there is a certain redhead who just shit's me  to no end. All night he never mentioned her by name and I do believe he was being cautious because of his affiliations with the ACF. More on this later. His next comment was that he usually gets someone up to spin the wheel and he was going to get Robbie O'Davis but he couldn't. "I was going to go anti rugby league but was afraid the local police would keep pulling me over" he joked. They went on and played a good mix of the "classics".</p>

<p>Part 2. They put a starters light (drag racing type) to the right of the stage and it's dark, there is a loud electronic engine noise and when the light goes "green" the car noise "goes" and the lights come up and "comfortable on the couch" (Haulaway) is played. They keep the stage mostly red for the Redneck Wonderland set. If there is other lighting they keep a red spot on Peter  in his "Nuke suit". It's pretty awesome as he "melts into the lights. The stage is reset with the banners I mentioned last with the addition of a fourth, It has birds and fish and says "Birds in the sky, Fish in the sea, Uranium in the ground".</p>

<p>Also on the ends of the stage I didn't mention before was two "redneck's" They took 3 poles and crossed them "teepee style" and wedged these dummies into the top. They had on Khaki's and flannel shirts with vests and gas masks. They were then draped with camouflaged netting.</p>

<p>He only made a few short rants between songs but his emotion was really strong last night. He told everyone to support the Newcastle Jabiluka (correct spelling from last time) protest group who had a table outside. During the Great Gibber plain they had whirling yellow "Radioactive" symbols with Redneck wonderland around the outside of the circle.</p>

<p>Another one which was also on Tuesdays gig was "remember your parents' parents, and their parents' parents, and their parents' parents, were part of the earth not any country.</p>

<p>And lastly my favourite, "there is a redhead from western Queensland who will fade into nothing when everyone finds her out, every time she opens her mouth she upsets a lot of people". And the readerboard pops up "Please Explain". </p>

<p>That is about it for last night, except Annette and I are mixed on the final Power & the Passion mix. </p>

<p>I did a quick poll and the woman seem to favour it more than men. I asked Annette what she thought an she admitted that Rob Hirst in a small tank top all sweated up and buff hammering the tank and drums could have had something to do with it. Huh, I say, I think girls just like disco....;>)...</p>

<p>Thanks for the bandwidth, see you Saturday from Selinas'.</p>

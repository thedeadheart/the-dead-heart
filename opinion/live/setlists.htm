<h1>The Perfect Oils Set List</h1></center>

<p>The following set lists are taken from the Powderworks mailing lists following a post by <em>Benjamin I.B. McNeil</em> stating his perfect Oils set. I've requested permission to re-print from the people who originally posted the lists, and in my usual way, if they don't want me to do so, they can simply mail me and the list will be removed. I hope you enjoy what the people on Powderworks think!</p>

<hr>

<p>1. Surfing with a spoon-- because of the excellent intro and because it's starting things off from near the beginning.<br>
2. Hercules-- a classic rocker to get the crowd fired up.<br>
3. Only the Strong and<br>
4. Read About It-- continuing to pump up the crowd and generally do some kickass rock'n'rolling!<br>
5. Dreamworld and<br>
6. Kosciusko-- more fun, powerful rocking-type tracks.<br>
7. Who can stand in the way-- time to slow down a bit. This one should fit in well right after Kosciusko.<br>
8. Jimmy Sharman's Boxers-- because I love this track & it's time to get the audience thinking and feeling some angst.<br>
9. Time to Heal-- a track about needless, horrifying war (JSB) is followed by one about putting things back together after conflict.<br>
10. Star of Hope-- give the audience some more angst, let'em worry about the future and themselves.<br>
11. Burnie-- every song from Who Can Stand... through to this one should combine for a real emotional low point. The audience must be made to question things, not just jump around and enjoy the powerful rocking tracks. The ending of Burnie ("I'll stay and I'll fight...") should bring back a sense of hope.<br>
12. Lucky Country-- a bit more upbeat, time to start bringing the tempo back up.
13. Brave Faces and<br>
14. Truganini-- bringing back the powerful sound without eliminating the sense of angst. This finishes out the regular set and kind of sums things up.</p>

<p>Encore (if the crowd doesn't demand an encore, well, they suck!)<br>
15. Progress-- a killer track that would have been a glaring admission from the set list. It should satisfy any lingering urges for some thunderous rock'n'roll.<br>
16. Shakers and Movers and<br>
17. One Country and<br>
18. Antarctica-- Aha, at last some material from BSM! Shakers and Movers because it's my personal favorite song. One Country because it's thoughtful and uplifting. (Actually all three of these are thoughtful and uplifting.) Antarctica because, as some people have said recently, it was a great way to end BSM. I think it's also a great way to end a concert.</p>

<p>Summary: this set list has 3 main parts: first the loud, powerful, fun-as-hell yet entirely serious rocking tracks from the beginning up to Kosciusko; then the quieter, more introspective stuff to affect the audience emotionally, Who Can Stand through to Lucky Country; then something of a reprise of the first part, Brave Faces through to Progress;
then the last three tracks to leave people thoughtful and hopeful, in a somewhat elevated mental state. (well I guess that's sort of four parts.) I think I would leave this imaginary concert wanting to go to dinner someplace quiet with my best friend, my girlfriend and his girlfriend, and talk about the state of the world and what we, personally, are capable of
doing about it. Maybe while drinking some wine or hot chocolate. Then go to sleep and have some spooky dreams. (Of course, before this could happen, I'd have to convince the aforementioned three people to start liking Midnight Oil. ah well...)</p>

<p>peace!</p>

<p>Read through this list again....imagine the roar of the crowd when that familiar distorted riff of Read About It begins, or of Garrett's raw anger in Progress, a song which you can't resist screaming along with. Obviously a few absences, particularly from Earth and Sun and Moon, Breathe and Blue Sky Mine. But don't you always find you scream the loudest when they play the opening chords of a song you never expected to.</p>

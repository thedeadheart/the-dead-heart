<p>My first MO concert? Ah, yes. It was in May 1990 (BSM tour - Spectrum, Phila, PA) and I asked my son, Eric, to come. He jumped at the chance to hear his favorite MO song, Dead Heart, sung live. It was an awesome gig. What we both really thought was so great was Peter orating throughout the concert.</p>
<p>One neat memory I'd like to share.....<br>
Right before the Oils came on stage, the last roadie was setting up the mikes for the band. He set them all up and began walking off stage. He abruptly stopped and turned and went to the middle mike (the one Peter was to be using) and pulled the head of the mike all the way out. Eric turned and looked at me asking, &quot;Mom, how tall is this dude?&quot; I answered, &quot;Oh, he's just five inches taller than you!&quot; Needless to say, Eric was impressed.</p>

<p>Well, seeing as this gives me another chance to tease Garrett of calling me the SLICK ONE, I'll recall my first OILS show. After anxiously awaiting some freedom in my life and a chance to see the OILS my first semester of college I was able to blow off classes for half a week to travel to see the OILS in Milwaukee, Wi at The Performing Arts Center or PAC as its known on 10-19-88.
Its a super-fancy theater for ballets and symphonies. Quite a strange place to see Yothu Yindi and the OILS play!! In fact Peter strongly stated after there first couple tunes that he think someone screwed up in booking them to this venue thinking it was a cultural speaking tour and not an actual rock concert! He asked us nicely to &quot;not touch anything!!&quot; It was very funny. I
wish I could remember the setlist and such or be lucky to have had someone record the show but no luck to this day finding the show. I think the most moving songs were the 10-1 songs and Red Sails stuff since I like those albums most, but Shipyards of NZ and Jimmy Sharman's Boxers moved everyone in the whole damn place. Well luckily I have been to see the OILS 7 times but
missed the ESM tour completely simply because it wasn't ADVERTISED!!!! They didn't stop in Wisconsin at all and this made it tough, hence I made it my mission to make as many shows as possible the rest of my life. I saw 4 of 5 shows on the last NA tour for Breathe and will try and hit more on the next tour.</p>

<p>I just wanna walk thru paradise!</p>

<p>Way back in 1986 (?), I was at LaTrobe University, living on campus. Midnight Oil were to play at the union hall there. It was to be my first MO concert. They even offered to play for free; well, at least that was the rumour. But f@&amp;*#*&amp;@$ LaTrobe wouldn't let them play because it was too close to exam time. Bastards.</p>

<p>Just out of interest, how about a survey of when our first Oils non-show was? Should be interesting...</p>

<p>Enjoyed your &quot;first show&quot; review. My first Oils show was way back in 1982 at the old Royal Antler Hotel (now known as the Sands, where the Oils kicked off their Sydney shows back in December). I am now 33 and am living here in the States (actually, I was born over here but raised down there). I have seen the Oils twice over here in Seattle (I am now living in Spokane - 300 miles due east of Seattle). There was some postings during the later part of '96 regarding the fact that many powderworkers were relating AMAZING stories that their parents were actually into the Oils!! Holy Mt Kosciusko(sp?). I posted my experience about that '82 show and finished it by saying there were many &quot;older Oils fans&quot; still out there and now living productive lives with real jobs and kids of their own. I received quite a few replies from fellow powderworkers (and even some of their parents) supporting what I had said and agreeing that the Oils have amassed quite a legion of fans over the past 25 years (give or take a few years). Many of the powderworkers that you hear from over this and other sites are mostly college-age but believe me when I say that there are many others who have been out of college for some time now but are still &quot;avid&quot; Oil fans.</p>

<p>Well, enough from me. Long Live The Oils....and Long Live All Of Us.</p>

<p>My first show was at the Felt Forum in NYC on October 7, 1988. I never heard non-D&amp;D songs until this concert. However, they inspired me to go out to the music store the next day to buy all of the non-D&amp;D albums and became a MO addict.</p>

<p>Also, FYI I am 30 years old.</p>

<p>You never forget your first MO gig. I certainly recall the Capitol Theatre, Sydney November 1982 where the band played some blistering shows to launch the &quot;10,9,8..&quot; album.  (Footage from those shows has turned up on the recent 20,000 watt video). I went to 3 shows in row...then basically collapsed afterwards! Well, its often been said - there's no spectators at an MO gig, only participants.</p>

<p>Fifteen years on, and many gigs later, my enthusiasm is still there. Perhaps because they're one of the few bands that are determined to continue to evolve and try new things...and in the process drag their fans along with them.  The fact that the Oils started in the 70s and remain relevant and important two decades on is testament to their talent and commitment to their music.</p>

<p>Politics?  A lot has been said about whether people really hear AND listen to the message or just get into the music. I don't think it really matters - you do what you want and the band has never been out there to covert people to a cause.  They just write songs about what they believe in...and put their time and money where their mouth is - as the many benefit shows over the years have shown.</p>

<p>As for memories, there are a lot. Years later you remember those special shows (in Sydney for me). Whether it be: legendary Hordern Pav ('84), Goat Island ('85), the Enmore Theatre ('86) or the majestic sweep of the Diesel &amp; Dust shows where they went back to the pubs in '87 ....it was an interesting experience to clock up 3 MO gigs a week for four weeks in a row!   Some great shows in the 90s, hmm a few flat ones too - probably the tour grind was starting to tell. Then fast forward to the Narrabeen Sands Hotel (1996) for a spiritual homecoming...and a hell of a gig.</p>

<p>As for first memory of MO.  Well if anyone else can recall the television ad for Head Injuries that was broadcast in late 1979 you'll know what I mean when I say &quot;wild!&quot;.</p>

<p>See you down the front.</p>

<p>With the other contributors to this section, I wish I was able to declare that I was awe-struck when I first experienced Midnight Oil in full flight. But alas, this was not the case.<br>
My first Oils gig was the second and last performance at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre in 1990 at which a good many of the tracks for their live album Scream in Blue were recorded.<br>
Unfortunately on the night they lacked energy and the crowd enthusiasm and participation, essential to raise any gig above the average, left a lot to be desired. Overall the Oils failed to fire and to live up to their legendary live reputation which I had been hearing about since I became a fan in the mid 80s.<br>
I put the lacklustre performance down to the fact that it was the tail end of an exhausting world tour and to be fair, the venue hardly afforded an intimate setting. (Even if my friend and I did have middle front-row seats.) Sensing this night was an aberration I have since sweated and been pushed, shoved, and stepped on in the front row of pubs and clubs across NSW and Queensland to experience the Oils' magic live, and savoured every minute of it. I have been pulled from the crowd by Peter Garrett to spin the Chocolate wheel; I have been handed a much prized pair of Rob Hirst's drum-sticks by Bones; I have contracted Chicken Pox (a top night out plus two week's off work for the price of a $30 ticket, value for money like that is very rare these days); woken up with my arm literally bruised black and blue after being crushed against the front barricade during a crowd surge one New Years' Eve; dealt with abusive drunks, and returned home on countless nights smelling of stale cigarette smoke and beer (despite the fact I neither drink or smoke)...and I don't regret a minute of it.</p>

<p>These are memories I will savour into my old age and I desperately hope I will have the opportunity to develop more such recollections when the Oils, who I'm pleased to say appear determined to grow old disgracefully, next hit the road.</p>

<p>My first Oils show was on May 26,1990 at Lake Compounce Amusement Park in Bristol,CT.<br>
This was the Blue Sky Mining Tour. Since my concert ticket also included admission to the amusement park, I spent several hours before the show riding rollercoasters and flume rides. I heard the soundcheck, although vocals were absent. During that check, I recognized "Instant Karma", a song they would perform a few days later in front of the Exxon building in New York City. Hunters and Collectors opened the show with a nice set. The lights went down and I could see the outlines of the group members as they took the stage. A calm voice said, "Thank-you for coming out tonight." Then the lights came on as the guitars erupted into "King of the Mountian", and there was Peter Garrett, in an oversized orange shirt,pumping the mike stand to the beat of the song. What a sight! I jumped up and didn't sit down for the rest of the show. I danced, sang, and marvaled at this group. As I watched Peter take charge, I was amazed by the energy he had. The newspaper review described him "like a lock-limbed Frankenstein rocking out" This huge bald man singing from the heart looked so menacing, but the few times he spoke to the crowd he was well spoken and almost gentle--looks can be deceiving. They played for about 2 hours and they even did Elvis Costello's "What's So Funny 'Bout Peace, Love, & Understanding" as an encore. Once the show ended, I was left wanting more--how could anyone who likes rock and roll not like these guys?</p>

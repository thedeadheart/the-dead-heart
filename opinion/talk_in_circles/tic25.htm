<ul><li><p><em>"Kilo pascals in my finger"</em> - as the Pascal is a measure of pressure, I guess kilo pascals signifies a lot of pressure. It's possible that Moginie wrote this to suggest that the finger has the power to apply a lot of pressure - either pointing the finger (eg in a court of law) or pehaps a finger poised over "the nuclear button"??</p>
<li><p><em>"God is hiding in this teacup"</em> - could this refer to people looking for divine inspiration by that ancient art of reading tea-leaves?</p>

<li><p>The actual lyric that's sung is <em>"God is hiding in this pickup"</em> so, referring to playing guitar, it fits perfect with the bit about <em>"kilopascals in my finger"</em>.</p>

<li><p>'God', in the sense used by the lyricist here refers to salvation - in the form of heroin.</p>

</ul>

<ul><li><p>Going by the title, is it some sort of anti-Rolf Harris statement. His wobbleboard can be pretty annoying at times! :-) But seriously, could it be something to do with Australia's image in the rest of the world. Maybe they dislike the idea that the world thinks Australian's pant and shake boards about all day long.</p>

<li><p>Old paintings of Australian landscapes never used to look right because the painters were using shades of green that were appropriate for English light and English plants, but not for correctly depicting what Australia looks like. Eventually, of course, people started using the proper colors and their paintings became more truly Australian and not British. So I take <em>"we're living in the dark, painting pictures of English green"</em> to mean that Australians are still too culturally dominated by England. A very republican sentiment.</p>

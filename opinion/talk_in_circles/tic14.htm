<ul><li><p>Fighting at the Somme (WWi - France) would have been akin to a caveman experience - living in muddy dugout caves and attempting to exterminate all living creatures. My Grandfather fought there, but never ever spoke of it. I think PG's did as well - listen to In the Valley.<br>
<em>"We could dive into distant amoebas"</em> - we tend to treat distant galaxies/constellations like single cells, because we can't get close enough to identify their structures. This applies at many other levels, all the way down/up to to our personal relationships.<br>
<em>"Our wings could melt in the sun"</em> - Icarus of the Greek legend<br>
It all seems to point to peoples inability to focus on what is important, and who thus make inappropriate decisions, which demean the value of life - especially the people that rise to the 'top' (the movers and shakers) who a) in the main lose their persepctive and b) have the most influence.</p>

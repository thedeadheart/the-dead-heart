<ul><li><p>I've heard several people refer to 'I see you' as a love song. IMHO it is about the loss of one's parents. The line <em>"I see you in everything I do"</em> could refer to how people recognise things their parents used to do and which they now do themselves.</p>
<li><p>How about the line <em>"Six days, since you took your love away"</em>?<br>
It could be interpretted, I guess, as the perspective of someone in the depth of grieving from the loss of someone through death. PG has said in the past, not to look too deeply into Oils' lyrics.  I think I'll stick with the broken relationship line.</p>

</ul>

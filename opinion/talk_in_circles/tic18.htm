<ul><li><p>Okay, sorry to be so obvious, but since no-one has yet mentioned it, I'll be the one to! Beds is clearly about the issue of Aboriginal Land Rights, that has gone on for years, and will no doubt continue. I guess as well as Aboriginals, the song could refer to abuse of land rights in other countries - I think the Maoris have a similar problem to the Australian Aborigines.</p>

<li><p>This song still has relevence today, especially with reconcilliation being a strong issue in Australia at present (perhaps John Howard should have a listen!).</p>

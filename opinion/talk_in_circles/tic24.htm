<ul><li><p>Burnie, a place with its own set of painful contradictions, is a city in Tasmania. I don't know what its condition is right now, but not too long ago it was suffering from some rather lethal problems with its indigineous industrial pollution. About two-and-a-half years ago the now-legendary Jason Mitchell, who went to college as an undergraduate right here in the great city of Cleveland, wrote to the list about a visit to Tasmania and said a word or two about Burnie. He said that what he saw of it was consistent with the imagery in Midnight Oil's song of the same name.</p>

<li><p><em>"It's not the promise of a swell or a girl, just the hope that someday, it'll be OK."</em> I've visited Burnie twice in the last 2 years,and there's no doubt that the Oils give an accurate portrayal of that town. Not only do the Oils pick-up on issues regarding the pollution and industrial rules of the paper-mills, but the hope instilled in the hearts of the people in the town. Hope is something Midnight Oil always picks up on.</p>

<li><p>Burnie, is about growing old. The surfer realizes that he must "grow up", and more specifically, get a job. The lines, <em>"This is my home, this is my sea, don't paint it with the future of factories"</em>, point to this theory. Also the line, <em>"Part time cleaner in a holiday flat"</em>, kind of suggests this idea too, the surfer is lamenting having a part time job knows that one day he must get a full time job and ultimately give up surfing, that his youth is coming to a slow demise. I don't know any of the Australian references, the idea of giving up freedom for work comes from my personal experiences in minimum wage jobs in America. I saw myself as the character in "Burnie", looking out and hoping that one day,it would be okay.</p>

<ul><li><p><em>"Working in the city from 9 to 5, Traffic on the highway gonna blow my mind, Surfing with a spoon all the rest of the time"</em> - this could be about the rigors of everyday life - working all day, then having a hobby to relax.</p>
<li><p>Although the general consensus in Powderworks was the opposite, this song could be about heroin use. Just because a member of the Oils wrote it, doesn't mean it's autobiographical. It could simply be the tale of high powered city execs, who like to shoot up after a hard days work?</p>
<li><p>Agree with the heroin thought, as a bit of a way of saying that we gotta get somewhere else and out of the rat race.</p>

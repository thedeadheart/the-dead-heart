<ul><li><p>There were several interpretations of the meaning of "One Too Many Times." The first is that the song is about an abusive relationship - a woman being being beaten by a man, but coming back to him anyway. The second interpretation (the one I favor) is that it is a song about mankind's abuse of the earth, and how resources are eventually exhausted (<em>"a second helping, third and fourth, its gone"</em>). In either case its an interesting song, lyrically and musically.</p>

<li><p>During the gig in the Elysée Montmartre theater, in Paris, Garrett dedicated this song to Johnny Rotten, who was carrying the 1996 Pistols' tour. The song having been written before that, that was only sarcasm, I suppose.<br>
"One Too Many Times" could also refer to the French nuclear testings, which were planned to be the last ones.</p>

<li><p>I agree with your interpretation about this song being man's abuse of the earth. It's definitely a statement about human nature - we humans don't know when to stop.</p>

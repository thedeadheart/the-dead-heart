<ul><li><p><em>"The light on the hill is so far away"</em> - an allusion to "River Runs Red"? Yes and no. Both songs are referring to a phrase coined by wartime Australian prime minister John Curtin: "The light on the hill," representing (I'm guessing), hope and something to strive towards. Curtin was a Labor (centre-leftish) PM, and is one of the more revered figures in Australian political history. I'd also guess that the lyrics may be a reference to the current political situation in Australia - a Liberal (usually centre-rightish) government was elected and has gone about establishing a firm neo-conservative political agenda. The Oils have always been opposed to such policies, and I'd guess that they're dismayed by this turn of events.</p>

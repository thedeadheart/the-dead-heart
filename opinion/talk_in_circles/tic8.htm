<ul><li><p>In this song, the first verse goes like: <em>"The rich get richer, the poor get the picture, the bombs never hit you when you're down so low"</em><br>
I'm not fully bilingual, but I figure that "down so low" would stand for down under (OZ). Am I right or is there still room for interpretation?</p>
<li><p>Call me a crazy left wing nutcase, but I always took this little ditty (specifically this verse) to mean that in the song (Read About It), 'the bombs never hit you when you're down so low' is referring to the fact that the wonderful media could give two squats about the poor and economically exploited and even if 'bombs were to hit you (to paraphrase),' we wouldn't 'Read About It,' since there is no profit in it and some might go so far (me....noooo...never) as to say that the media (being a tool of the corps) purposely keep us in the dark so we never get the whole picture. Then again, maybe the song is talking about short 
people....what do I know?</p>
<li><p>From the way that I understood it, mainly with the bombs, I interpreted 'the bombs never hit you when you're down so low' as the richer people hiding in bomb shelters. Only they would truly be able to afford good ones.</p>
<li><p>In general I think Read About It was an attack on the media - that what is reported to us is based on what the media barons/moguls want us to know?</p>

<li><p>Read About It is an attack on the highly class-conscious business, white majoritarian, mainstream media in Australia who frame news according to their agenda of waging a bitter class-war on working people.</p>

<ul><li><p>I'm not sure who asked the other day (I think it might have been Brian) about Arctic World. In answer to the question, YES it was written specifically to the President of the United States of America (at the time it was good old Ronnie Raygun) asking him to stop the stockpile of nuclear weapons and the arms race. Has anyone REALLY listened to this song? It has some great words it in and some great symbolism as well ie if there is a nuclear war the world will become sterile and lifeless just like the arctic (how the arctic looks on the surface anyway!) "There is nothing that grows in this Arctic world".</p>
<li><p>Also Arctic World could be a song about a relationship gone wrong - an arctic world could easily be someone's cold attitude to another person.</p>

<li><p>I also think this song was witten to the President of the United States of America since the lyrics say "I don't want to breathe that Smithsonian air, I don't want to listen when they toll the Bell". These lines are clearly refering to Washington DC's Smithsonian Institute and to the Independance Bell. This is sont is in my opinion one of the most beautiful written by Midnight Oil. A "Chef-d'oeuvre".</p>

<ul><li><p>I don't know if "My Country" is about Ollie North and Iran/Contra per se, exactly, only about the sort of atrocities that are carried out in the name of "national security" or "the national interest", when in fact they are motivated by the lowest of intentions, usually unfettered greed. North posed as a patriot fighting for good American values in order to wage a terrorist war - "the flag a camouflage for your deceiving". Rob Hirst said they were using the phrase "as a coverall for the sort of mentality that takes over which denies the conventions of Rome and Geneva and into which young men of all nationalities are thrust...there is a mentality when you're on the wrong side of a bren (?) gun or a .303 or a self-loading rifle that you can commit any sort of atrocity in the heat of the moment.  My Country is about that sort of mentality that takes over in war."<br>
He also makes references to the US's (and others') use of force in Viet Nam and Central America to maintain control over those areas. That's from the ESM interview disc.

<li><p>The line "<em>there were children at the shelter</em>" seems to refer to the Gulf war, when the US Air Force bombed a shelter - which they thought was a military target - and killed about 60 civilians.</p>

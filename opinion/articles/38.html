The band, originally called 'Farm', had existed in various forms since 1971 - but in '76 they changed their name and released their first, self-titled album in 1978, to be followed in '79 by another release, 'Head Injuries'</p>

<p>1980 saw a lineup change and an LP called Bird Noises (November 1980). In 1981 the band traveled to London to record the album "Place Without a Postcard", often cited as Midnight Oil's first turning point.</p>

<p>1982 saw a return to London to record one of the most incredible albums recorded by any band, anywhere. <b>"10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1"</b> turned Midnight Oil into superstars in their homeland. Songs like "Power and the Passion," "US Forces," and "Short Memory" became instant classics.</p>

<p>1984 saw the release of "Red Sails in the Sunset" which spawned some wonderful tracks, including "Kosciusko" and "Best of Both Worlds." The following year, after a tumultuous period in history both for Australia and the Oils that saw Peter Garret running for election on a Nuclear Disarmament ticket, the band spat out a killer EP called Species Deceases (December, 1985) that included one of their most memorable anthems, "Hercules."</p>

<p>What happened next was a revelation -- a watershed event in the history of Midnight Oil. In 1986 the band undertook a tour of remote outback settlements with Aboriginal rockers 'The Warumpi Band'. The tour exposed the group to experiences, both positive and negative, that left a profound impact. The resulting album, "Diesel and Dust" reflected these experiences in extraordinary songs like "Beds Are Burning," "Dead Heart," and "Dreamworld."</p>

<p>With "Diesel and Dust" clocking up sales in excess of five million they returned to the studio to make another incredible album, Blue Sky Mining. Tracks like "One Country," "Blue Sky Mine," and "Forgotten Years" revealed the band taking on new international perspectives whilst losing none of their passion, commitment or songwriting ability.</p>

<p>In 1992 The Oils released a blistering live set, "Scream In Blue (Live)", which was followed in 1993 by an album that reflected a refreshingly human side of the band, "Earth, Sun and Moon". Recorded partly live with analog instruments in a decidedly low-tech studio, "Earth, Sun and Moon" set a new musical course for the Oils which was continued with their 10th album, "Breathe" released in October, 1996.</p><p><b><font size=4>From <a href="http://www.sonymusic.co.uk/">Sony Music UK</a>, by </font></b></p><p><font size=-1>(<b>Note:</b> this article has not been approved for reproduction.)</font></p>

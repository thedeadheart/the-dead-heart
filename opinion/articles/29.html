<p>Ten minutes before the band was due to go to air, guitarist Martin Rotsey was in the dressing room - but couldn't find his pants!</p>

<p>Recovery host Dylan Lewis invited Rotsey to go into his personal wardrobe and, if anything fitted, borrow something to wear during the performance.  Fortunately, Lewis turned out to be the same size as Rotsey - who was so comfortable in the wrong trousers that he forgot he had them on and wore them home to Sydney.</p>

<p>A month later, Rotsey has received a phone call from the ABC wondering "if Dylan could have his favourite pants back" - but he refuses to surrender the daks without a fight.</p>

<p>Rotsey claims the band had such a good time on Recovery that they are holding the pants hostage until Midnight Oil gets a personal invite from Lewis to come back on the program!  Meanwhile the Oils will perform at Heaven nightclub on Feb 20 and the Bridgeway Hotel on
Feb 11.</p><p><b><font size=4>From <a href="">Adelaide Newspaper</a>, by </font></b></p><p><font size=-1>(<b>Note:</b> this article has not been approved for reproduction.)</font></p>

But as he approaches the new millennium  and the dreaded age of 50  ROD SAVAGE asks if Peter Garretts time as a preacher to generations is coming to an end? </B></p>

<p>It was a perfectly ironic moment. A United States Air Force pilot approaches Peter Garrett in a swish Perth hotel lobby, looking for tickets to Midnight Oils sold-out show the following night.</p>

<p>Garrett suppresses a smile as he immediately recognises the irony and gives this US Forces pilot the nod. Hell see what he can do. He laughs openly when the thankful pilot leaves  16 years ago, Garrett was spouting off about the evils of the US Forces on the classic Midnight Oil album 10,9,8,7,6,4,3,2,1. Now hes giving them free tickets.</p>

<p>Surely Australias most outspoken musician, the man with hands the size of Uluru, a head as bare as the Rock and an opinion that is just as imposing, isnt mellowing?</p>

<p>Suggest that to this relaxed 200cm-plus giant and youre likely to find those hands clamped around your throat  figuratively speaking, of course. Garrett may furiously defend what he believes in but hes not the violent type.</p>

<p>Besides, his recent actions  with the band he has fronted for more than 20 years, Midnight Oil, and his individual excursions  speak for themselves. The Oils, as this quintessential Aussie band is known across the world, has just released what is arguably its hardest hitting album yet. Titled Redneck Wonderland, it is a blatant dig at the seemingly growing issue of open racism in Australia and a warning to stamp it out, to take a stand. Now. He knows it wont be easy.</p>

<p>"If youve got to wrestle with a demon, you cant hide in a cupboard or go off and read a Jeffrey Archer novel and pretend it doesnt exist," he says, rubbing his hand over his bald head.</p>

<p>"Youve got to be out there among it all and try and find a place that has relevance and meaning for you. If enough of us do that then what seems intimidating can be brought into something more positive and hopeful. But it will require a lot of hard work."</p>

<p>Hard work is certainly something Garrett is used to. From achieving an arts and law degree in the mid 70s to (unsuccessfully) running for the Senate with his Nuclear Disarmament Party in 1984 to fronting the Australian Conservation Foundation for four years and being on the international board of Greenpeace, Garrett works hard for what he believes in.</p>

<p>And despite many of the issues Garrett was fighting 20 years ago still being in existence, he doesnt feel his personal crusade  and the Oils very public message  has been for naught.</p>

<p>"All of the issues that Midnight Oil was involved in, during the 80s have moved forward," he says. "At the same time we have not inherited a government that is determined to turn the clock back. Its just a case of whether Australians want that or not. I hope they dont."</p>

<p>He leans back, content with his answer sipping his Redback beer  and in doing so exposes the white T-shirt he wears under his jacket: a box of matches adorned with the famous image of the red-headed woman. Except this woman has been changed to look like One Nation leader Pauline Hanson, and instead of the matches reading "Redheads", it reads "Redneck".</p>

<p>He notices the T-shirt is the subject of attention and grins viciously. "Mambo (a surf clothing manufacturer) made it for me," he says. "It didnt come in XXXL, so they did this one especially." How much influence does this woman that adorns his chest have?</p>

<p>"I dont think anyone knows that, " he says, shifting forward again.</p>

<p>"But if taken seriously and if not countered appropriately, she is dangerous enough to derail our civic life, punch a hold in core Australian values and introduce schismatic and highly volatile decision making in the political system. I accept, however, that we have to defend the right of people to hear what they want without being jostled or threatened."</p>

<p>With that in mind, the following scenario is put to Garrett a decade from now, if One Nation is still operating and Pauline Hanson is still at the helm, his eldest daughter comes home and informs her father that she is sympathetic to the One Nation cause.</p>

<p>Garretts probing eyes narrow slightly. He always listens hard to what is being said and his mind, it seems, is constantly ticking over. He pauses for up to 20 seconds when forming an eloquent answer and will often mouth words without saying them, as if tasting their verbal effect.</p>

<p>For this question, he leans back deep into his chair, extremely wary of his next words. Garrett does not enjoy talking about his family publicly  even in hypothetical situations  and he obviously isnt enjoying this question.  Still, true to form, he does not duck.</p>

<p>"Id probably say lets have a talk," he says after what seems an eternity.</p>

<p>"Id say, 'let me take you on a slow waltz through history', thats all that you can do. Your kids, when they become adults, are entitled to form their own views and go in different directions than their parents."</p>

<p>In all the countless articles written about Peter Garrett and Midnight Oil, not one has mentioned the names or ages of his three young daughters. When asked for that information, Garrett simply shakes his head.</p>

<p>"I am always at considerable pains to keep them one step removed from the public element of my life," he says. He admits his family and Midnight Oil is like being involved in "tug-of-war".</p>

<p>"Ive always rated family life highly and, like with anyone who has a job that involves travel, youre always a happier person when the rubber band pulls you back in the front door." That rubber band is becoming increasingly stretched.</p>

<p>For here is a man who  already going a million miles an hour  last month stepped up his commitments by being reappointed the Australian Conservation Foundations president after his stint there from 1989 to 1993, and who will be involved in yet another lengthy tour of the United States later this year.</p>

<p>Garrett assures there is no risk of the (rubber) bank snapping from the strain. At 45, Garrett could be 20 years away from turning 50, such is the level of his energy and commitment. Is he fearful, though, of hitting 50? Garretts response, for once, is immediate. "Nope, Its a long way away." What about ageing generally?</p>

<p>"Its not an issue for me," he says.</p>

<p>"Music can be timeless and ageless. I can get off on what Jebediah (a young four-piece band from Perth) do. I can listen to hip hop performed by New York kids in their teens. And after a while when they were born has got absolutely nothing to do with what Im listening to. Its a sad fact that a lot of people are put in the too-old capsule. I hope were going to see a total rethink of ageing. I hope we reject this fountain of youth mindset in exchange for what a person brings. I feel tremendous sorrow for people in their 40s and 50s who know a lot, can work a lot, yet cant find a place."</p>

<p>Peter Robert Garrett has certainly found his place in Australian culture and, some would argue, folk lore. His distinct dancing style  like a pile driver set on overload  is an image that instantly comes to mind when speaking of the Australian music industry. It is an image that has been with us for 20 years  since the Oils released its first self-titled album in 1978  and is likely to remain with us for many years to come.</p>

<p>And it seems the current political turmoil has sparked a new fire in the band.</p>

<p>Does Midnight Oil, therefore, need the very issues it is campaigning against to write an inspired, cohesive album? Redneck Wonderland, Diesel and Dust and 10...1 suggest so.</p>

<p>Garrett, jokingly, reels backward. He puffs out his cheeks and rubs both mitts over his head and face at the suggestion. "I guess so," he finally says simply and surprisingly.</p>

<p>"The band has always been at its best when its up against it, when its trying to hold itself together, and also when were up against something that were all clear on, that we all have a gut feeling about. In that sense, those records mentioned probably work.</p>

<p>"I guess the spark of Midnight Oil is when there are issues like that." He stops, thinking of the best analogy to explain his answer.</p>

<p>"The bricks and empty bottles are landing on the roof of the corrugated iron shed and were in there furiously playing the soundtrack to this turmoil." Later, long after the interview has finished, Garrett returns to this question as if it has been playing with his mind since he answered.</p>

<p>"I actually dont think were an issue-driven band," he says. Before he is duely informed that is the direct opposite of what he said earlier, Garrett holds up on tarantula-like hand to buy time to explain. "We are a notes-and-rhythm-driven band that is fuelled by issues. I like that better."</p>

<p>The Oils, like Garrett (he admits one could not exist without the other), is also driven by the instinct of survival. "Of the thousands of bands that start and break up, we stuck together," says Garrett.</p>

<p>"Of the issues that people took up then left we stayed with them. And with the Oils, what you see is what you get. Im not going to slit my wrists or do an opera. After a while of people constantly getting this message, they start of think you are fair dinkum." Garrett smiles.</p>

<p>"That is, I guess, the ultimate compliment in Australia."</p>

<h3>Garrett Thoughts</h3>

<p><B>On parallel importing</B>: (The Australian Federal Government recently passed legislation to free up the importation laws of CDs  something Garrett has fought for seven years).<BR>
"It is to the total detriment of a successful, viable Australian Industry. It was a trading off of the hypothetical  of slightly cheaper CDs against the existence of a viable Australian industry. To do this, when youve got a buoyant and exciting set of emerging young artists, well, its a decision without sense and without regard to the community. There will not be a single signing of an Australian band from this decision."</p>

<p><B>On regrowing his hair</B>: (He had long blonde locks as a child). "Never has the thought crossed my mind. In fact, hair discussions are completely so far removed from my universe that I am now officially ruling them out in order."</p>

<p><B>On keeping fit</B>: "I try to stay away from Slurpies. The damn things are everywhere."</p>

<p><B>On becoming Australian Conservation Foundation president for the second time:</B> "Its probably true that I didnt complete my first term and a half there (1989 - 1993). I had a range of other things to get stuck into overseas and I couldnt do it all at once. Im extremely positive about having another chance and feeling very energised about the work we can do."</p>

<p><B>On getting back in politics:</B> "Ive never shut the door and Ive never left is open. I cant really say anything else because its not taking up a lot of my thinking time. yet no one can predict whats going to happen tomorrow."</p>

<p><B>On not blitzing the American market after Diesel and Dust album:</B> "At the end of the day, mate, youve got to ask yourself are you LA zipcode or Manly Warringah postcode? Thats the decision we made and we dont regret it."</p><p><b><font size=4>From <a href="None">The Adelaide Advertiser's Weekend Magazine</a>, by Rod Savage</font></b></p><p><font size=-1>(<b>Note:</b> this article has not been approved for reproduction.)</font></p>

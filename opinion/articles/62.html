Describe your perfect Sunday.</b><br>
<em>A late brunch with friends, lots of laughter and an afternoon of solitude with my dog in the park.</em></p>

<p><b>2. Your new single, Redneck Wonderland, seems to have more of an electronic feel - is this the Oils moving with the times or wanting to break new ground?</b><br>
<em>It's actually Rob playing like a machine, which gives the impression of loops being used. Have we ever moved with the times?</em></p>

<p><b>3. Describe your forthcoming album in three words.</b><br>
<em>Corrugated iron, dingo-smelling, fur ball.</em></p>

<p><b>4. What does the album title Redneck Wonderland refer to?</b><br>
<em>There's a piece of graffiti scrawled on an electricity substation in Melbourne by the Yarra River, with a map of Australia and the words "Redneck Wonderland" written across it. Underneath the map is a statement - will the forests that survived the ice age survive the Howard government? Save Coolengook Forest - and those two words just stuck with us.</em></p>

<p><b>5. Who are the three people you would most like to have a beer with?</b><br>
<em>Slim Dusty, Marilyn Monroe, silverchair when they are old enough.</em></p>

<p><b>6. If you had to become a Simpsons character, who would it be and why?</b><br>
<em>Santa's Little Helper, because I'm dumb and loyal.</em></p>

<p><b>7. What is your favourite album at the moment?</b><br>
<em>Jeff Buckley - Sketches For My Sweetheart The Drunk.</em></p>

<p><b>8. When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?</b><br>
<em>Santa's Little Helper.</em></p>

<p><b>9. Where will the Oils be in 20 years time and what will they be doing?</b><br>
<em>Probably decomposing.</em></p><p><b><font size=4>From <a href="None">Sunday Telegraph</a>, by None</font></b></p><p><font size=-1>(<b>Note:</b> this article has not been approved for reproduction.)</font></p>

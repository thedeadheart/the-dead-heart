<p>After the runaway success of <em>20,000 Watt RSL</em>, the band return with the perfect flip side loaded with political angst and the Oil's celebrated organic fury. Exposing the dark underbelly of Australia, <em>Redneck Wonderland</em> embodies a community's growing anger at the troubled policies of economic rationalism.</p>

<p>Commenting on the origin of the album title, front man Peter Garrett says: "There's a piece of graffiti in Melbourne by the Yarra River scrawled on an electricity sub-station with a map of Australia and the words 'Redneck Wonderland' written across it. Underneath the map is a statement: 'Will the forests that survived the ice age, survive the Howard Government? Save Goolengook Forest,' and those two words just stuck in me."</p><p><b><font size=4>From <a href="">CitySearch</a>, by Jane Rocca</font></b></p><p><font size=-1><b>(Note:</b> this article has been approved for reproduction.)</font></p>

First time though? Second time? Third time?</b><br>

<em>Pete: Yeah [laughs], how many times have the Oils played in Broome? It's the first time we've played in Stompem Ground. It's a total buzz for us, to be able to come out and just to play with all these people. And the music is just... it's got a lot of passion, it's got a lot of heart in it. It's very good out here.</em></p>

<p><b>Leah: And the theme?</b><br>

<em>Pete: Well I think it's really important. We just recognise that there's this whole history in Australia and families were split a part and now they're coming back together and the idea that we had a stolen generation and that generation now has to become the new generation. And I think all the stuff I'm hearing from musicians, all the things that's going in Broome in Naidoc week. It's all very positive. It's all very forward looking. It's all very optimistic. It's a lot different from what we read in the newspapers. And so it's nice to be a part of that. To touch it. To feel it.</em></p>

<p><b>Leah: And to share culture.</b><br>

<em>Pete: Absolutely</em></p>

<p><b>Leah: To share it not only with not only Aboriginal people but non Aboriginal as well.</b><br>

<em>Pete: [to Leah] We're sharing it together [laughs].</em></p>

<p><b>Leah: That's it, we certainly are - The 'White Skin, Black Heart'; that's it, love it, love it. But you were up in Jabiluka, can you fill [us in] about...</b><br>

<em>Pete: I spent two and a half days on the blockade at Jabiluka - very intense days in my political life. Six hundred people there in the camp. This uranium mine in the best national park of Australia needs to be stopped. We need to really get a good strong grass roots movement 
moving. People lettin' our leaders know that as far as we're concerned, in the 21st century we don't want this to be a part of the way that we live.</em></p>

<p><b>Leah: Yeah well, very sad.</b><br>

<em>Pete: Well, y'know, I mean they've wanted to do it for sometime. Kakadu is Australia, it's Aboriginal people, it's the nature of Australia, it's the tourists that come in there, it's the young Australians earning a living, sharing the beauty of the country. It's not a place for radioactive waste. It doesn't make any sense. And we're going to campaign really hard. We're going to fight hard and we need lots of help.</em></p>

<p><b>Leah: Excellent, so everyone get behind...</b><br>

<em>Pete: Absolutely</em></p>

<p><b>Leah: Now, Redneck Wonderland. New one huh? Big one?</b><br>

<em>Pete: Well I think so. I think, what can I say about it?, We've got another lease. The band's playing very, very strongly, they're very, very focused on the music. We really put a lot into the album. We really thought about it and we thought 'we're going to do something basically which reflects what's happening here now'. Using Magoo to produce it to begin with. But we're also going to bring the Oils' musical strengths into it as well. Hopefully the combinations paid off.</em></p>

<p><b>Leah: Where'd you get the title from?</b><br>

<em>Pete: It's just a bit of graffiti we saw in Melbourne about what we're doing to the bush and it sums it up doesn't it? We've got a great Wonderland but, we can't get rid of the Rednecks!</em></p><p><b><font size=4>From <a href="None">Recovery</a>, by Leah Purcell</font></b></p><p><font size=-1>(<b>Note:</b> this article has not been approved for reproduction.)</font></p>

A band that has rallied against injustice, apathy, inequality and the lurking evil forces of cynicism and conservatism with sound, fury and righteous indignation. A band that has written more wonderful songs, and more things that count, than virtually any band in the history of music.</p>

<p>Redneck Wonderland was recorded in Melbourne with the bulk of the production duties handled by the band and Warne Livesey (Diesel and Dust and Blue Sky Mining).</p>

<p>Of the origin of the album's title, Peter Garrett said:<BR>
"There's a piece of graffiti in Melbourne, by the Yarra River, scrawled on an electricity substation with a map of Australia and the words Redneck Wonderland written across it. Underneath the map is a statement: Will the forests that survived the ice age survive the Howard Government. Save Coolengook Forest, and those two words just stuck with us."</p><p><b><font size=4>From <a href="http://www.sonymusic.com.au">Sony Music Sound Bytes</a>, by Sony Music Australia</font></b></p><p><font size=-1>(<b>Note:</b> this article has not been approved for reproduction.)</font></p>

<p>Redneck Wonderland is the first single from the Oil's forthcoming album of the same name. Already being widely hailed as an Oil's classic, Redneck Wonderland screams at you with a crunching guitar riff that indicates a ferocious re-alignment of the band's sound.</p>

<p>Redneck Wonderland was leaked to punters on Sony Music's website May 15.  It caused an unprecedented number of hits with radio stations downloading it for broadcast. Redneck Wonderland is now all over the airwaves in its official form, and a radical video is about to explode. And prepare yourself for the onslaught that is Midnight Oil live. The band load up the trailer, hitting the road July 1 for their most extensive national tour in years.</p>

<p>Of Redneck Wonderland, bass player Bones Hillman put it like this: "It's a corrugated iron, fur ball, dingo smelling, razor edged, rubber spinning, trucker burning existence and state of mind. It's ferocious, tough and menacing."</p>

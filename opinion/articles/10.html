Now, after a years sabbatical, Midnight Oil are back with a brand new album, <em>Breathe Underwater</em>. (sic)</p>

<p>It's nearly ten years now since Midnight Oil broke internationally, in 1987 to be precise, with what was their sixth album, <em>Diesel and Dust,</em> which reached #21 in the US charts, with the single, "Beds Are Burning", making it to #17. That album reflected their experience of Australia's central desert regions and its indigenous people, the Aborigines, and confirmed a commitment to both that saw the band touring North America the following year with the Aboriginal band Yothu Yindi as their support act.</p>

<p>Midnight Oil's next album <em>Blue Sky Mining,</em> released in 1990 got to #20 on the US charts, and was similarly uncompromising in either lyrical content or the driving rock that has always been at the core of the band. The Oils made their name originally by their uncompromising stand, never subverting their sense of musical mission to fashion, recording and releasing to their own agenda, even when they came to a mutually agreeable deal with multinational label Columbia (now Sony Music).</p>

<p>In 1993 came <em>Earth and Sun and Moon,</em> returning to themes reflecting their vantage point as socially active Australian musicians who have always attempted to marry meaning and song in their music. Their last release was a benefit single "Land" recorded with composer/producer Daniel Lanois, Liam O'Maonlai (Hothouse Flowers) and Gord Downie (The Tragically Hip), recorded on the run in Calgary Canada and released in January 1995, when the Oils joined Crowded House, Hunters & Collectors and a new Australian band, the Electric Hippies for a summer tour of Australia.</p>

<p>Now, after a year's sabbatical, Midnight Oil are back with a brand new album, <em>Breathe</em>, the first single from which is the power rock groove, "Underwater," recorded live in the studio, and the first of the surprises you can expect from this unique band.</p><p><b><font size=4>From <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/">Rolling Stone Online</a>, by </font></b></p><p><font size=-1>(<b>Note:</b> this article has not been approved for reproduction.)</font></p>

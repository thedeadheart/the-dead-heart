<p>"It was a really interesting process because it started with this quite intense, very open ended almost kind of free expression sessions that we did in Sydney. We didn't start off with songs or anything like that. We just basically started with nothing and just sat around the room looking at one another for 8 hours a day until something started to happen. That was an interesting few weeks. Out of that we had a body of stuff that we decided to go with."</p>

<p>"It's really locally driven in terms of content except that maybe there's a sub plot going on. In each place there's young people and other people who want to see a basic maturing of humanity to the extent where you don't blame and castigate people because their eyes point in a different direction. I think that's a really strong theme to the record."</p>

<p><em><b>...about Breathe...</b></em></p>

<p>"Heading down the Breathe path for us I think was actually a really essential thing to do. It was almost like the emotional Spring cleaning, then you come back and try something which is a bit edgier which is what Redneck is."</p>

<p><em><b>...RW's sound...</b></em></p>

<p>"Its a little dense isn't it? I think it's less a landscape record and more of an urban reflection record."</p>

<p>"I'd been across to Europe at the end of last year and heard what was happening in Germany and places like that and heard how hard and tough the sounds were getting. I think for us it was a case of do we stay where we are or do we move?... And we knew we had to move."</p>

<p>"I don't think you can have this kind of content in placid form." reasons Garrett. "We have always recognised that there are going to be complexities in the way people come onto the band."</p>

<p>"We're going to have One Nation voters out there, there's no doubt about it. We're just going to have to set them straight and have tapes and software and reprogramming systems out in the dressing rooms to deal with them. First lesson: history. Go back to... Hitler! Remember him? Its not Hogan's Heroes..."</p><p><b><font size=4>From <a href="http://www.beat.com.au/">Beat Magazine</a>, by None</font></b></p><p><font size=-1>(<b>Note:</b> this article has not been approved for reproduction.)</font></p>

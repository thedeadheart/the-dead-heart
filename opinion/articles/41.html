<p>(Billy) I'm only a youngun, but was it not true that when you guys were coming through, Molly Meldrum had his show that gave new aussie artists a huge boost if they got on it, and also Triple J played a lot more new australian stuff. Is this true? Do you think the lack of this sort of thing now is a major mistake by the music industry in australia?<br>
<i>Billy: Lots of bands went on Countdown and we weren't one of them ...  Double J as it was called at the time, and particularly DJs like the late great George Wayne, really helped us and lots of other bands that weren't prepared to do corny TV shows ... (Rob)</p></i>

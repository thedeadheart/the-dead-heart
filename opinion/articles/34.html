<p>A Midnight Oil session has always been an emotive experience and 'Redneck Wonderland' their new album is no exception.</p>

<p>An Oils experience moves you, it's full of passion and angst, it's mighty and potent, before you know it your pulse is pacing and your blood is boiling with heartfelt emotion. In true form of what is Midnight Oil, to cap off NAIDOC Week, the band will headline this year's Stompem Ground Festival in Broome on Saturday July 11.</p>

<p>The theme for this year's National Aborigines and Islander Day of Celebration is &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; the story of the stolen generation and Midnight Oil is renowned for it's on going support for the rights of our Indigenous people.</p>

<p>Of NAIDOC Week, Peter Garrett, lead singer of the band, said:<BR>
&quot;Playing at Stompem Ground will be a highlight of the Redneck Wonderland tour because it will be black fellas and white fellas making music together; being honest about the past and feeling positive about the future. Stompem Ground way to go!&quot;</p>

<p>The Oils will hit centre stage to show their support for Stolen Generation at 11.45pm, part of their performance will be broadcast live around Australia on the ABC.</p>

<p>Midnight Oil's new album, 'Redneck Wonderland' (in stores Monday July 6) arouses excitement with the bands poignant sentiments. Think Australiana, the strong elements, fauna and flora, wheels spinning in the dirt and dust, city skyscrapers and businessmen in suits with little consciousness - it's a strong contrast, it's a metaphor and it's realism. 'Redneck Wonderland' it's a state of mind.</p>

<p>The land fights back...and Midnight Oil are unleashing their 'Redneck' fever!</p><p><b><font size=4>From <a href="http://www.sonymusic.com.au/">Sony Music Sound Bytes</a>, by Sony Music Australia</font></b></p><p><font size=-1>(<b>Note:</b> this article has not been approved for reproduction.)</font></p>

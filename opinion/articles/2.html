The Greenpeace-sponsored rally drew a crowd of over 2,000 peaceful protesters who were later treated to a raucous 50-minute set by the doggedly political Australian rock band. Responding to a petulant question regarding his right to be there, gangly lead singer Peter Garrett said, "This is the same as the old South Africa argument that goes, unless you live in South Africa, you can't say that racism is wrong.

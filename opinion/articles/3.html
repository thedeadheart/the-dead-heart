Before some 10,000 bewildered onlookers, the quintet offered a typically raucous set to protest the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. A video documentary of the concert titled "Black Rain Falls" was issued shortly thereafter, with proceeds going to the environmental group Greenpeace.</p>

<p>Midnight Oil has, in fact, combined an acute awareness of political, social, and environmental issues with an aggressive rock sound to create one of the most distinctive voices in current popular music. From the moving depiction of the plight of Australian aborigines featured on the 1987 album <em>Diesel and Dust,</em> to the bitter commentary of "My Country," about America's  Iran-Contra scandal, found in 1993's <em>Earth and Sun and Moon,</em> Midnight Oil's "agit-rock," as <em>Rolling Stone'</em> s David Fricke once called it, has urged their audience to dance - and think.</p>

<p>The original nucleus of Midnight Oil was made up of drummer Rob Hirst, guitarist-keyboard player Jim Moginie, and bassist Andrew "Bear" James. The three friends began playing together in Sidney in 1971 and by 1972 had founded Farm, a group that performed cover versions of songs by Led Zeppelin, Cream, and Creedence Clearwater Revival. The group gained some media attention by touring Australian coastal resorts during the summer.</p>

<p>In 1976 Farm advertised for a lead singer and found one in Peter Garrett, then on leave from law studies. Garrett shaved his head--adding a striking visual element to the group that would become the singer's trademark--and the band toughened up its sound, developing what Fricke called "something akin to the early-seventies Who with a leaner, punkier pub attack." Later that year, guitarist Martin Rotsey rounded out the group and the ensemble changed its name to Midnight Oil.</p>

<p>By 1978, Midnight Oil, under the able guidance of manager Gary Morris, had begun to find a wide audience through explosive live performances at inner-city pubs in Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide. Inevitably, the band was approached by record company executives, but in order to maintain control over their music, the bandmembers decided to form their own, independent label, Powderworks, on which the first, self-titled Midnight Oil album was released in June of 1978.</p>

<p>In November of 1978 Midnight Oil began to build a reputation as political activists by playing a concert at Sydney Town Hall to protest Australia's policy on uranium mining. Within a few months, the group was playing benefit concerts for the Save the Whales and Greenpeace organizations, Garrett eventually joining the latter as board member.</p>

<p>For the next several years Midnight Oil continued to record and toured England and the U.S. They received a great deal of press - especially when Garrett decided in 1984 to run for the Australian Senate on the Nuclear Disarmament Party ticket - yet commercial success remained beyond their reach; as drummer Hirst told <em>Rolling Stone'</em> s Fricke, "We were the best-known band in America never to sell records." It was not until the group began to take a closer look at what was occurring literally in their backyard that Midnight Oil finally exploded onto the international scene.</p>

<p>In July of 1986 the group mounted what it called its "Black Fella White Fella" tour, during which it traveled to some of Australia's most remote aboriginal settlements with the Warumpi Band, itself made up of aboriginal musicians. While performing in these far-flung spots, the group witnessed directly the atrocities that Australia's native people have suffered at the hands of white settlers in over 200 years of colonization; they saw communities devastated by poverty and disease.</p>

<p>Shocked and confounded, the group immediately began writing material for a new album. <em>Diesel and Dust</em> was released in August of 1987, and despite the ugliness of its subject matter and angry sound--grippingly captured by Garrett's anguished and commanding vocals--the album became a worldwide success and spawned the group's first hit single beyond their native shores, "Beds Are Burning." The record prompted a major tour of Australia, followed by extensive jaunts through Europe, the U.K., and North America. Although the group had existed for 12 years, audiences all over the world began discovering Midnight Oil for the first time.</p>

<p><em>Blue Sky Mining,</em> the follow-up to <em>Diesel and Dust,</em> featured a change in personnel; Peter Gifford, who had replaced James on bass, was himself replaced by New Zealander Bones Hillman. The focus of the new record was more expansive; songs like "Blue Sky Mine" and "Stars of Warburton" continued to address topics specifically concerning Australia, but others, such as "Antarctica" and "One Country," took a more global view. Another commercial success, the disc was Midnight Oil's most critically acclaimed effort to date and prompted another round of international touring.</p>

<p>In 1991, the members of Midnight Oil took a year off, though they continued to remain politically active, giving a series of outdoor benefit concerts for the 
homeless and Garrett spending a year as president of the Australian Conservation Foundation. In 1992 the group issued a compilation of live performances called <em>Scream in Blue,</em> which Fricke evocatively described as "real guitar nirvana: crisp, catalytic agit-twang, pregnant with steely menace, shivering with skittish vibrato and erupting in enraged screams of ice-pick feedback."</p>

<p>Midnight Oil's tenth studio album, <em>Earth and Sky and Moon,</em> retreated from the studio slickness of <em>Diesel and Dust</em> and <em>Blue Sky Mining</em> in order to recapture the rough-edged sound of the band's early pub days. To record the set, the group rented a small facility near Sidney's international airport--"our own little grunge hole," as Garrett described it to <em>Billboard</em>--and relied on spontaneous musicianship rather than hi-tech wizardry. The result was a highly personal collection of what <em>Billboard'</em> s Melinda Newman called "stripped down, thunderous music."</p>

<p>During their discussions with Newman the fiercely self-reliant group also addressed their 1982 move to the major label Columbia. "Coming over to Columbia was always a big step for us as an independent-minded band," admitted Garrett, "and part of it was predicated on the basis that Oils is Oils; what you see is what you get." The singer continued, explaining, "Our deal works in a different way to how must people's arrangements work in that it has more of our own underwriting and control in it."</p>

<p>Though Midnight Oil has maintained their status as what Garrett somewhat jokingly referred to in <em>Billboard</em> as a "terminally serious band appearing at the right places for the right things," they have lightened their image somewhat. Garrett went on to admit, "You can't be 100 percent politically, ideologically, ecologically, musically, spiritually, socially correct. You can only do it on your own level." Even as the group continues to spread its message with conviction, it remains at heart a hard-driving, no-frills rock band.</p><p><b><font size=4>From <a href="">Music Boulevard</a>, by Jeffrey Taylor</font></b></p><p><font size=-1>(<b>Note:</b> this article has not been approved for reproduction.)</font></p>

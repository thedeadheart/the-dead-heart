<p>Why this album can't sell like amyl at the Cross I don't know! It's surprisingly unique and aggressive yet, in no way basic. Each song contains it's own style, yet all songs have that unique Midnight Oil sound.</p>

<p>Peter Garret (vocalist) has his own brand of originality. Not only in his voice, but in appearance. He's six feet, eight inches tall and bald. His hand motions and style of performance are incredible and if you can control yourself from dancing, then it's great to watch. Without doubt, the band have a much greater impact when seen live - but don't let this stop you from getting the album. Only the raging atmosphere is lost in the transformation from stage to vinyl.</p>

<p>Fortunately the lyrics are included with the record. Lyric lovers may not rave over them, but without them in writing, would find it hard to work them out. Lyrically, Nothing Lost - Nothing Gained wins the prize. The others are mainly concerned with city life.</p>

<p>Yes folks, there's more to come! Their live performances are loaded with other interesting originalities which don't appear on the album. Set Me Down Easy, I Don't Wanna Be The One and another one which I love but can't understand the words to title it! Anyway, seeing them in concert can give us a taste of what is to come in their next album, which should be even better than this one.</p>

<p>The success of this album has been held back by a solid wall of disco krap. This is the band Australia has been waiting for. Don't let them down. I know they can go far.</p>

<p>Midtown Manhattan mixes the atmosphere of several different cultures in a span of several city
blocks. Men and women in business attire walk side by side with musicians on their way to the
record label, housed in high rise buildings. Actors and actresses tending bar by day to pay the
rent while waiting for their big break serve the tourists who have come to see what the Big Apple
is all about. It was in this unlikely melting pot that Midnight Oil performed a live concert in 1990,
in front of the Exxon Building (now simply known as 1251 Avenue of the Americas), to warn
the people of New York City of their environmental responsibilities.</p>

<p>But then again, Midnight Oil has always been in the forefront of situations that others might not
have approached. Led by the imposing Peter Garrett, the Oils are one of the most respected
bands in terms of mixing rock and politics. Although some acts choose to cloak their meaning in
double-talk and hidden representations, this Australian band have always been in-your-face with
their messages. </p>

<p>Probably the most representative track of Midnight Oil's 22 year history is "Blue Sky Mine".
The title track to their 1990 album takes the viewpoint of a long time asbestos miner, fighting to
stay alive (financially from poor pay, as well as literally from the deadly asbestos), wondering "If
the Blue Sky Mining company won't come to my rescue / If the sugar refining company won't
save me / Who's gonna save me?" Poignant connotations - bribery of politicians and newspaper
editors - revolve around a song which retains its fresh guitar chords today.</p>

<p>Of course, Midnight Oil is much more than just one song. To non-Australian audiences, this 18
track compilation will serve not only as a fine representation of the past, but a look into the
future. True, the big American hits are here ("Beds Are Burning", "Dead Heart") as well as
shoulda-been hits ("Power And The Passion", "Dreamworld", "Forgotten Years",
"Kosciuosko"), but 20,000 Watt R.S.L. also includes two new songs. And rather than ripping off
Midnight Oil fans who have 'every album' by forcing them to buy the 2 new songs, they've
included the same songs on the forthcoming Redneck Wonderland (slated for an early 1998
release).</p>

<p>These tracks follow in the strong Midnight Oil tradition. "What Goes On" fits in finely with many
of their earlier tracks (but with a tighter feel to it), while "White Skin Black Heart" sounds a bit
like INXS - if Michael Hutchence gained a spine.</p>

<p>File this one under political rock, mate.</p>

The figure above is the main pattern of the song, it is used during
the intro, verses, and outro.  The timing of this phrase is constant, but
the timing of the lyrics is not, so listen closely to the song to get the
feel for how the words fit on top of this.  The chords are all played in
this form, (even in the bridge and chorus sections) although simpler
versions will also sound decent.  The bracketed chords in the bridge
section are played very quickly (you may choose to skip them).

We're gonna move those mountains aside

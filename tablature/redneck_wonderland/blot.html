Welcome Stranger listen in
The presumption of innocence was buried again
Carve up-selloff
Triumphalism gotta be a curse or even worse
It's inherited It's recurring, oh God

(okay this next bit is well dodgy as it sounds like some 
kind of pitch bend's been used):

Riff AX10

The triumphalist and narcissist are joined ear and hip and phone
They're worshiping their chrome
Carve up-selloff
Some people speak with chainsaw tongue,
some just golden arches smile
some relish others suffering, some just run and hide

Chorus (similar to last time):

I have dreamed I have screamed I have made myself clean
do you know what I mean
I have sat I have strayed got caught up
and I prayed do you know what I've seen

Verse: with riff (sometimes)

The story's just the same but the
ending it can change
He wants to build a monument it's everlasting in cement
It's cellular recombinant he is not lite
he will not die
Carve up-selloff

With Riff A:

Gonna pick up all the pieces they're available from species
With all the goat and all the sheep and all the
human bits and pieces but he'll make you
sign the DNA releases... welcome...

In the year of the reign of the real citizen Kane,
Wilkommen, the squeeze is on, it's a falling down
on thou and I...

<h3>2nd Tab</h3>
This is pretty rough, particularly as far as the timing goes, but it's a 
start.  It's basically in 4/4 time, but the bars marked * are half length.

  Welcome to sharp edges

  Some just golden arches smile
  Some relish others suffereing
  Some just run and hide

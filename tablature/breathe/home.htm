Can be played as barre chords or if you're lazy (like me) with a capo
at first fret using C, G, F and Am.

C#    G#     F#   X4

C#       G#       F#
There is a town I was born
It is a place I’ve never seen
Don’t even know where it is
Don’t even know my name

A#m      G#    A#m          F#
Where is home,     where is my home?
A#m                     G#
   I’m searching far and wide

C#    G#              F#
       It’s a bastard song
It is the feeling that everything’s wrong
We are alive, we that have wings
We have devices can do anything, I say

A#m      G#    A#m        F#m
Where is home,   where is my home?
A#m                 G#   
   I hear my spirit cry

F#                             C#
If you’re out of transmission, way out on the road
F#                                 C#
If you’re out of commission I can, give you the code
F#                          C#
Darkness is coming and it’s in your command
F#                 G#
Time to be moving, time

C#   G#    F#  X2

C#           G#         F#
  There is a town I was born
Now there’s a place I’ve got to call home

Where is home, where is my home?
I’m searching far and wide, oh yeah
Where is home, where is my home?
I hear my spirit cry
It’s in the clear blue sky

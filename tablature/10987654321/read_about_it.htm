(It's pretty hard to play this way, so I suggest ignoring the notes
on the B-string)

LYRICS:

INTRO

    B        E           B           E
the rich get richer, the poor get the picture

    B          E                     G#m
the bombs never hit you when you're down so low

   B        E        B      E
some got pollution, some revolution

      B             E              C#m             A
there must be some solution but I just don't know

    B            E              B           E
the bosses want decisions, the workers need ambitions

       B          E                     G#m
there won't be no collisions when they move so slow

B           E         B             E
nothing ever happens, nothing really matters

B            E               C#m                   A
no one ever tells me what am I to know, so what am I to know


   you wouldn't read about it, read about it

   D
   just another incredible scene, there's no doubt about it

B         E            B           E
hammer and sickle, the news is at a trickle

    B          E                 G#m
the commisars are fickle but the stockpile grows

B           E         B           E
bombers keep coming, engines softly humming

     B                 E                    C#m           A
the stars and stripes are running for their own big show

B             E           B              E
another little flare up, storm brewed in a teacup

B          E              G#m
imagine any mixup and the lot would go


nothing ever happens, nothing really matters

B          E                 C#m                   A
no one ever tells me what am I to know, so what am I to know


  you wouldn't read about it, read about it

   D
  one unjust ridiculous steal, ain't no doubt about it


  you wouldn't read about it, read about it

   D
  just another particular deal, ain't no doubt about it

INTRO

BRIDGE

the bombs never hit you when you're down so low

   B        E        B      E
some got pollution, some de-evolution

      B             E              C#m             A
there must be some solution but I just don't know

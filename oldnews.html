<font size="5" color="#FFFF00">Peter Garrett Calls It A Day</font><br>
<b>Oils:</b> In a statement on the front page of the official Midnight Oil web-site, Peter Garrett has announced his decision to retire from the band in order to focus on his other commitments.<br>The full text from the official site: -<br><br>Pete has resolved to call it a day with Midnight Oil, resigning from the band to take up challenges outside music.<br>'The last 25 years have been incredibly fulfilling for me, and I leave with the greatest respect for the whole of Midnight Oil. The band has brought a lot of pleasure and meaning to people's lives, including my own. Who could ask for more? But it is time for me to move on and immerse myself in those things which are of deep concern to me and which I have been unable to fully apply myself up to now.'<br>The band wishes Pete all the best for the future and reinforces the respect, good intentions and values we mutually share. Jim, Rob, Martin & Bones plan to continue making music together in another guise at some point down the track.<br>'We've had a unique relationship and special chemistry for many years, one too good to lose.'<br>'We want to thank our families, all fans worldwide, our crew and the Office team for their enormous support over the years. It's been a great ride together. Many, many thanks.'<br>Signed<br>Peter Garret, Bones Hillman, Rob Hirst, Jim Moginie, Martin Rotsey and Gary Morris

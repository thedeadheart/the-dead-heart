<td valign=top><b><font size=4 face="ARIAL">Notes:</font></b></td>
<td valign=top><font size=3 face="ARIAL">This show was recorded in Christcurch New Zealand, on the 20th February 1988. It was recorded from the audience so the quality is not the highest out there. However there is a good range of tracks from the Diesel period as well as a few from older albums. This show was part of the Diesel and Dust Tour of 1988. Notably absent from this recording is Beds Are Burning - the song was played at the concert, but an over-enthusiastic audience member sang along so loudly the track was spoiled for the recording. It should have occured between Shipyards of New Zealand, and Don't Wanna Be The One.</font></td>

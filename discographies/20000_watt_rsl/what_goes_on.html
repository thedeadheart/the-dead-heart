<pre><b>One thing's for sure
That it's still the same
That young folk die
For some noble aim
And they live so fast
But they die so young
And we just keep wondering
What the hell went wrong

Yeah, they live so fast
But they die so young
And we just keep wondering
What goes on

It's such a shame
Such a useless shame
That they have to play
Such a hopeless game
And it makes me shake
Makes me shake with rage
For the wasted lives
For nothing gained

Coz they die so fast
And they die so young
And we just keep wondering
What goes on?
What goes on?
What goes on?
What goes on?
You tell me what goes on?
What goes on?
What goes on?

You got a good thing before
You got everything to live for
Ain't nothing you want to die for
No, no, nothing at all

Coz you live so fast
But you die so young
And we just keep wondering
  wondering, wondering

<pre><b>Yeah, whatcha gonna do now, now that you started?
Whatcha gonna do now, now that it's done?
The words got out there, they float around and are coming right back down.
You gonna leave us lying here
Dealing with the consequences of a bad sound
Of a bad sound.

White skin black heart
White skin black heart

Whatcha gonna do now, that it's spoken?
These words of a habit of not fading away.
Our memory is clear, conscience gets opened like a wound.
If you can't conceive a better line and better times,
Then let silence bury you, in the end.
When you feel it
You're condemned.

You see the Boston Strangler on the freedom road! You 
think ........................of something a long time ago!  You 
[spewed it out you were so] insecure!  It was like ............. on 
the toilet floor!  You're a nazi drunk,  ...............  and 
you say you want something, ..........    you heard the rednecks 
roaring for blood and then they wanted more! Life was so small, you 
couldn't get enough.  You made a start.

White skin black heart
Dripping,
White skin black heart

Drag your eyes from [aurora] black heart!
Drag your leg, get outta here [my sight]!
You didn't have to start
White skin black heart
White skin black heart</td></table>

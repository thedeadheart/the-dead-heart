<p>To date five Midnight Oil albums have been released on the MiniDisc format. These are still available to buy on the web, and it is possible to buy some of them in stores as well. There isn't a whole lot of difference between the MiniDisc and CD versions of the albums, and in general it is simply a case of a slight varying of the information presented in the inlay. It is worth purchasing <a href="20000_watt_rsl/rsl.htm">20,000 Watt RSL</a>, as the standard album is almost 76 minutes long. In general, most blank MDs run to 74 minutes and 59 seconds in length. Dubbing RSL onto MD results in the loss of the end of Forgotten Years. Luckily, the manufacturers squeezed the extra minute onto the pre-recorded MD, so there's no cut-off - a silly reason for making the purchase, but a reason nonetheless!</p>

<p>The five albums available to buy on MD are shown below...</p>

</p>

<p>To obtain the MDs over the Internet, you need to visit 2 stores. To obtain 20,000 Watt RSL head to <a href="/media/store/gregsmw.html#rsl">Greg's Music World</a>. The other four are available from the British online store <a href="http://www.yalplay.com">Yalplay</a>. Note that these discs were still listed in the respective stores' online catalogues at the time of writing.</p>

<p>Whilst not exactly rarities, these MiniDiscs are a collectible Oils resource. And if you have a MiniDisc player, it would also be another good way to notch up another sale for the Oils, that might just help next time their record label is deciding whether or not to release new material.</p>

<pre><b>Who'd like to change the world, who wants to shoot the curl
Who gets to work for bread, who wants to get ahead
Who hands out equal rights, who starts and ends that fight
And not not rant and rave, or end up a slave
Who can make hard won gains, fall like the summer rain
Now every man must be, what his life can be

So don't call, me, the tune, I will walk away

Who want's to please everyone, who says it all can be done
Still sit up on that fence, no-one I've heard of yet
Don't call me baby, don't talk in maybes
Don't talk like has-beens, sing it like it should be
Who laughs at the nagging doubt, lying on a neon shroud
Just gotta touch someone, I want to be

So don't...
(One country one, country one country)

Who wants to sit around, turn it up turn it down
Only a man can be, what his life can be
One vision, one people, one landmass, 
We are defenceless, we have a lifeline
One ocean, one policy, seabed lies, 
One passion, one movement, one instant
One difference, one lifetime, one understanding
Transgression, redemption, one island,
Our placemat, one firmament
One element, one moment, one fusion, yes and one time

(Moginie/Garrett)

<p><b>About</b></p>

<p>This discography was designed and created with the aim of cataloguing every Oils release ever available. It aims to include promotional releases, as well as the standard fare. The information is never likely to be complete, as a 20+ year career can generate many releases which may or may not be in wide circulation.</p>

<p>A further reason for the database was to provide a searchable discography that was more complete than that already available within <a href="/main_page.php">The Dead Heart</a>. The current discography was static and patchy and had to be updated. The database and interface design (and coding) was performed by Maurice R. Kelly. The information came from the <a href="/discographies/">existing discography</a>, the old <a href="/oilbase/">Oilbase</a> discography, a number of "collections" listed on the web, and listings from online stores and auction sites.</p>

    Few of the sins of the father, are visited upon the son<br>Hearts have been hard, our hands have been clenched in a fist too long<br>Our sons will never be soldiers, our daughters will never need guns<br>These are the years between<br>These are the years that were hard fought and won<br>Contracts torn at the edges, old signatures stained with tears<br>Seasons of war and peace, these should not be forgotten years<br>Still it aches like tetanus, it reeks of politics<br>How many dreams remain? This is a feeling too strong to contain<br><br>The hardest years, the darkest years, the roarin' years, the fallen years<br>These should not be forgotten years<br>The hardest years, the wildest years, the desperate and divided years<br>We will remember, these should not be forgotten years<br><br>Our shoreline was never invaded, our country was never in flames<br>This is the calm we breathe, this is a feeling too strong to contain<br>Still it aches like tetanus, it reeks of politics<br>Signatures stained with tears, who can remember<br>We've got to remember<br><br>The hardest...<br>Forsaking aching breaking years, the time and tested heartbreak years<br>These should not be forgotten years<br>The blinded years, the binded years, the desperate and divided years<br>These should not be forgotten years, remember

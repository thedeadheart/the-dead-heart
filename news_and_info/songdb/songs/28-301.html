    I've seen faces in the window<br>I've seen faces in the street<br>They talk and walk of nothing<br><br>I've known many restless summers<br>The sand dunes I imagine<br>A place without a postcard<br><br>Flower people were so beautiful<br>But straight and loud's the way<br>Good luck the beatnik spirit<br><br>The talk of politicians<br>The sentences of cynics<br>Are the sentences of childhood<br><br>They're all talking shit to me<br><br>Out-talked by the mass media<br>To pay the bills it lies<br>And the lies we eat with breakfast<br><br>Brave faces face the boardroom<br>The oak-stained walls fall silent<br>They leave lined with defeat<br><br>They got those tears in their eyes<br>Well it makes no sense to me<br><br>When we dance, when we dance<br>On the night, on the night<br>You saw me, I looked right<br>I was the one with my head in the cloud<br>Up and down, round and round<br><br>Why don't they understand<br><br>We're so ordinary too<br><br>I saw the exits closing now<br>Pain and passion's my point of view<br>Well there's nothing like the truth, oh yeah, oh yeah...<br><br>I've seen men that have been marked out<br>Ruled out by grim assassin<br>They fell hard on instant replay<br><br>And I'm never going there, no I'm never going there<br>Well the place I see so much better<br>So much better<br>Getting high, getting low<br>Well it makes no sense you know<br><br>I saw the exits closing now<br>Burning mountain, burning paper<br>Burning all around and later

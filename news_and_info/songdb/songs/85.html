    I just want to see that clear clear ight<br>Don't want to be a member of a species that's deceasing<br>Keep on making those promises that they aren't keeping<br><br>Oh I was a talking to the people next door<br>Said they don't want to die in a nuclear war<br>Now we went walking down the old north road<br>We got a common cause we got a heavy heavy load<br><br>Watching pictures of the world<br>Watching pictures as they pass me by<br>Don't stop at that light<br>Don't go out at night<br>My artificial heart<br>Expensive spare parts<br><br>I've been a sailor on the sea I've been a flyer in the air<br>I've seen a whole lot of bleeding hearts out there<br>They don't talk so much I tell you they still care<br><br>They can't go on living like this they can't go on<br><br>Don't sit around in silence you don't need a licence<br>It's moving in a hurrythere's no need to worry<br>We're really going to change it the critical mass approaches<br>I can almost hear it

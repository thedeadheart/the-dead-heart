    In this city with no footpath there's a building with no people<br>There is crime and gun decisions<br>There's a street of heat and hawkers, there's a house of hope drifters<br>There's a gang that shoots then listens<br>There's a place that knows no poverty, a town without pollution<br>There's a soul with good intentions<br>There are canyons full of movie stars, churches made of metal<br>There are mountains made of muscle<br>We have leaders who are anxious, we have captains not courageous<br>Captains tumbling into madness<br>But there's a main who makes no enemies, a body never breathless<br>No ambition ever hopeless<br><br>Up on bedlam bridge somebody is waiting<br>Up on bedlam bridge I'm shot to heaven<br>Oh, up on bedalm bridge, waiting<br><br>In these locked and shackled neighbourhoods, bridge and tunnel diplomats<br>See the golden ghetto's creeper<br>Crazy flags from history, songs for the White House gangsters<br>Guns for hellgate railway sleepers<br>But there's a main who makes no enemies, a body never breathless<br>No ambition ever hopeless<br>So how stands the city on this winters night?<br>The city on the hill or so they said<br>The snow is falling down around the armoury<br>The city's closing in around my head<br><br>Up on bedlam bridge...<br><br>Drive, won't you drive the engines harder, drive<br>Drive, won't you turn the engines over, drive

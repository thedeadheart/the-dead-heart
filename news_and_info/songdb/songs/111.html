    I, I was, I was shaken down in a toy town<br>He, He's out there<br>You know it's Kennedy's shadow from White Cross to Michigan<br>ATM's, are in the air, oh yeah machines they are spinning out everywhere<br><br>The speaker is speaking<br>Can you hear the sound<br>The listener is listening as he hits the ground<br>The medium or the message but there's no one around<br><br>I couldn't believe<br>I couldn't believe the stars of Warburton were waiting for me<br><br>We were dancing, we were dancing on the plain<br>We're looking through the window didn't see any buffalo there<br>We got our pipe dreams, they went up in smoke dreams<br>Burn it clean in the climate control, of your hypermark malls<br>Don't wanna talk about Elvis Presley<br>Don't wanna see his white shoes walking around<br>And around and around over here<br>The press baron's acting up the mainframes are down<br>Newspapers crawling around on the ground<br>The medium or the message still there's no one around<br><br>I couldn't believe<br>I couldn't believe the stars of Warburton were waiting for me<br><br>Over the hills and mountains we go, so far, so far away<br>For the ring of the axe on the ironbark, for the smell of the wallaby stew<br>From the golden reefs to the sandstone cliffs<br>Came the sheep of the Mallee plain<br>The wind blew the soil to the Orient, we'll be shouting to the skies again<br><br>I couldn't believe<br>I couldn't believe the stars of Warburton were waiting for me<br>I couldn't believe<br>I couldn't believe the stars of Warburton were living in me <br>Raining down on me, were washing down on me

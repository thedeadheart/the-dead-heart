    My grandfather went down with the MonteVideo<br>The rising sun sent him floating to his rest<br>And his wife fled south to Sydney seeking out safe harbour<br>A North Shore matron she became with some paying guests<br><br>My father went down with the curse of big cities<br>Traffic tolls and deadlines took him to his peace<br>Now Bob Dyer glued us to our seats<br>And lawns were always Victa neat<br>Whilst Menzies fawned at royal fleet do you remember?<br><br>In the valley I walk, I took some comfort there<br>In the valley I walk, cold comfort I can hear you talk<br>In the valley I walk, who will take me there?<br><br>When my mother went down it was a stiff arm from Hades<br>Life surprises and tears you like the southerly<br>She always welcomed the spring always welcomed the stranger<br>I don't see too many around like this<br>Oh no, that's what I'm looking for, yeah, what we're looking for<br><br>In the valley I walk - who will take me there<br>In the valley I walk - cold comfort I can hear you talk<br>In the valley I walk - I took some comfort there<br>In the valley I walk - oh rough justice I hear you talk<br>In the valley I walk - to meet my watershed<br><br>I hope virtue brings it's own reward<br>And I hope the pen is mightier than any sword<br>I hope the kids will take it slow<br>I hope my country claims it's own<br><br>In the valley I walk - I cried yes I cried I was down then I crawled<br>Mercy's arms all around me when I was down there<br>In the valley I walk - do you read me they can hear me in the valley

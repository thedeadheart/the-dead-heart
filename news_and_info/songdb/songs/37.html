    These are not dispassionate words of the cool<br>The headline still rules, the editors a fool<br>Shall we douse out the flames or will everybody fuse<br>And leave us stranded here tomorrow<br>I heard a calling out, a cry from the heart<br>From the towns of cement and no beauty<br>A whisper its turned howl, man he didnt know<br>He was standing waiting for tomorrow<br><br>Nothings left, nothings found, there must be some common ground<br>Nothings left, nothings found, there must be some common ground<br><br>I could never figure the calendars flow<br>Nor can I work out how the wild, wild wind blows<br>But were ready from within and were starting to go<br>Away from the place of no tomorrow<br><br>Nothings left, nothings found, there must be some common ground<br>Nothings left, homeward bound, I see there must be some common ground<br><br>Oh the wrecking fields are a terrible place <br>With a sulphurous smell and a frightening pace<br>And the Hook is early and the critic is king <br>Its hard to stay human and stand in the ring <br><br>Theres no time to be absent, a clown or a fool<br>While Shylock is smiling were loaded like mules<br>If we surrender ourself to industrial rules<br>Well wake up in the wreckage of tomorrow<br>Now<br><br>Nothings left, nothings found, there must be some common ground<br>Nothings left, somethings found, can we see some common ground

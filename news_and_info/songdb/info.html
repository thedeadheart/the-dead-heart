	Why Does It Exist?

	This database was implemented to bring more information to Midnight Oil fans. I recently had a glance at <a href="/oilbase/" target="_parent">Oilbase</a> and happened to see the <a href="/oilbase/song.disc/preamble.html" target="_parent">song discography</a>. While the efforts of the original compilers is much appreciated, it was noted that the song discography ceased to be current as of the release of Earth and Sun and Moon (as does all of Oilbase). This (literal) database was envisaged as a means of bringing the old song discography up-to-date, both in terms of the information and the technology.<br>

	What Does It Contain?
</td>

<td class="bot">
	In general terms it contains a list of every song the Oils have recorded/written. The idea was to catalogue every Oils song known, and provide a centralised resource of information. This information is comprised of song-writing credits, production details, version history, lyrics, and possibly even musical notation. The use of a database is intended to enhance the visitors use of the resource by making searching a lot easier than browsing page by page.

	Using It
</td>

<tr>
<td class="bot">
	The database should be fairly intuitive. The top frame should contain a list of letters of the alphabet. These links will produce a list of songs beginning with the letter chosen down the left-hand frame. Alternatively the link "All Songs" will list all the songs down the left hand side. Clicking on a song title in the left-hand frame will cause the details to appear on the right hand side. Amongst the details you may see the following symbol - <img src="sm-sprint.gif" width=18 height=16 border=0 alt="Link"> - this represents some form of link - generally to outside the database (tabs and discographies.)<br>
	At the bottom of each song entry you'll see a link to "Corrections" - click this link if you wish to mail a correction to me.<br>
	The "Search" link in the top frame will open up the search form - more details on searching can be obtained by following the link at the bottom of the search form marked "Search guidelines..."<br>
	"About" bring up this page, and "Stats" will show you some details about the database. "Admin" is a link to a password protected section for priviledged people only (at the moment that means me only!)

	This database couldn't be possible without a number of people - the Oils, the original compilers of Oilbase, the fans who have sent info to The Dead Heart, visitors to the site, and the people who host these pages.

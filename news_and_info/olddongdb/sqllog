Don\'t want to live in smoking room

Say your prayers for the past
It might be round the corner
It might be all we have
Say your prayers

Couldn\'t live with a compromise
Couldn\'t live with hypocrisy
Beaurocracy it doesn\'t have to win
Breaks the cage of the beast within

Say your prayers in the boardroom
Say your prayers on the stairs
It might be catastrophic
It might be too damn bad
Say your prayers

I got the cure for compassion fatigue
Spend a week with the Timorese
Running scared from the military
You can share, you can share your disease

Now we won\'t live with an absent master
Couldn\'t live on an island divided
Don\'t want my kids to grow up in shame
In a country with a different name
Had to throw them out
Had to break the chains

Say your prayers for the future
Say your prayers for the past
It might be round the corner
It might be all we have
Say your prayers

Spend a week with the Timorese
Running scared from the military

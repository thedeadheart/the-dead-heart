	The Text Entry Field...

<td class="bot">
	This field is used to specify your search string. At the moment it will accept basic text strings, including multiple words. Multi-word entries are treated as phrases (i.e. the individual words are ANDed). If you enter the text "in my", the search returns those entries that matches both words <em>in the order they appear</em>. This isn't very flexible, but at this stage the possible search demands are not that extensive.

	Search Options

	The fields the individual options refer to are fairly self explanatory. However, some mention of how the search uses the options is required.<br>
Multiple options can be used at once to extend the range of a search - in this way it is possible to search for the same text across multiple fields at once. For example if you search for the word "heart" and check the boxes for "Song name" and for "Version Details", you will get a list of songs which contain the word "heart" in either "Song name" OR "Version Details."

	Once you've put in your text and options, you will click the "Search" button, and the database will do it's thing. It generally comes back with some form of result, and redraws the search form below, in case you want to try another search (Note that when it is redrawn, the form will contain the same options you put in before.)<br>
If your query had no matches, you'll see a message to that effect.<br>
If you did not specify any text, or if you selected no options, then the search form will reappear with no results.<br>
If you struck gold and the database matched your query, it will reload with a list of the matching songs. Click on a song name in order to load the song details in this pane. To help you see what you're looking for, the search text will be highlighted in <b>bold text</b>.

	Common Search Examples
</td>

<tr>
<td class="bot">
	These are examples for a number of types of search it is expected this database will be commonly used for.<br>
<b>Information on an individual song</b>: - simply enter all, or part of, the song name, and check only the "Song name" option. Note that this is the default option.<br>
<b>Songs written by</b>  - Enter the surname of the writer, and check only the "Writers" option.<br>
<b>"The song whose lyrics are something like..."</b> - enter a snippet of the lyrics, and check only the "Lyrics" option.

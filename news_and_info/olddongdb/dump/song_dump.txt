If the sugar refining company won\'t save me

Stare out to sea at the ships at night
No anaesthesia, I\'m gonna work on it day to day
No zephyr no light relief it seems

But maybe it\'s a dream
I\'m lying back in a row of timber cases placed out
On the dock with nightmare faces looking at me
And I can see now, and I wanna be free now

This is my sea
Don\'t paint it with the future, of factories
I want to stay, I feel okay
There\'s nothing else as perfect
I\'ll have my way

Waste product, pedestrian, limb from limb
Short changed by the surfing priest again
Two children in the harbour
They play their game stormwater drain
Write their contract in the sand, it\'ll be gray for life

But you can draw the blind
But you can\'t stop the sun
From shining on and on and getting you there
Tide forever beckons you to leave
But something holds you back
It\'s not the promise of the swell or a girl
Just a hope that someday someway it\'ll be okay
So you stop and say

This is my sea
Don\'t paint it with the future of factories
This is my life
this is my right

Way down down,
Down by the docks of the city

Blind and dirty,
Asking for a dime,
A dime for a cup of coffee,
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

My name is August West,
And I love my Pearly Baker best
More than my wine,
More than my wine--
More than my maker,
Though he\'s no friend of mine

Everyone saying
I\'ve come to no good
I knew I would -- Pearly, believe them

Half of my life,
I spent doing time for some other fucker\'s crime,
The other half found me stumbling round drunk on burgundy wine

But I\'ll get back on my feet someday,
The good Lord willing, if He says I may
I know that the life I\'m livin\'s no good,
I\'ll get a new start, lead the life I should.

I\'ll get up and fly away,
I\'ll get up and fly away,
Fly away

Pearly\'s been true,
True to me, true to my dying days,
I said to him,
I said to him, I\'m sure she\'s been
I said to him, I\'m sure she\'s been true to you

Got up and wandered,
Wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just hang around

I gotta girl,
Named Bonnie Lee,
I know that girl\'s been true to me
I know she\'s been, I\'m sure she\'s been true to me', 'None');

<h3>Alice Springs</h3>
<em>"In Redfern as there is in <b>Alice</b>"</em> - Warakurna (Diesel and Dust)<br>
<em>"Darwin down to <b>Alice Springs"</b></em> - Kosciuszko (Red Sails in the Sunset)<br>
Probably one of the most famous towns in Australia, as far as the rest of the world is concerned, Alice Springs is often considered to be "next door" to Uluru (Ayer's Rock), but is actually quite a distance away. Alice is one of the biggest population centres in the centre of Australia.<br>

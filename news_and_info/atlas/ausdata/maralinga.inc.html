<h3>Maralinga</h3>
<em><b>Maralinga</b></em> - Maralinga (10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1)<br>
In the 1940's and 50's, the English continued atomic bomb tests in South Australia. These were performed in appalling conditions with virtually no regard to safety, the environment or the indigenous peoples who considered the area to be a part of their sacred homelands. The site of the tests was Maralinga, which is named after the indigeneous tribe. Recently, the UK government agreed to pay compensation for the devastation it wrought upon the area, which is still uninhabitable. <em>(excerpt from Oilbase (compiled by Brian Perry))</em><br>

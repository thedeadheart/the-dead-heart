<h3>Charleville</h3>
<em>"Darkness over <b>Charleville</b><br>
The fires begin to glow"</em> - Kosciuszko (Red Sails in the Sunset)<br>
"Charleville is a town in south central Queensland, on the Warrego river at an elevation of 974ft. Settled in 1842 and named for Charleville in Ireland, it developed as a service centre for the sheep belt. The first regular Qantas air route in Australia - between Charleville and Cloncurry - was inaugurated in 1922, and the town remains a major outback base for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Officially gazetted in 1868, it waas proclaimed a municipality in 1894." - <em>(from the Encyclopaedia Brittanica)</em><br>

"Canberra is the federal capital of Australia, and is located in the northeastern section of the Asutralian Capital Territory (ACT). A small squatter' settlement of stockmne called Canberry, or Canbury (a derivation of an Aboriginal term menaing 'meeting place'), was made there as early as 1824. By 1836 the name had evolved to Canberra. Following the inauguration of the commonwealth in 1901, the site was chosen for the new capital in 1909, and the delineation of the ACT followed.<br>
A worldwide competition was launched in 1911 to find a design for a new federal capital, and the winning plan was submitted by the US architect Walter Burley Griffin. Construction began in 1913 but was interrupted by World War I. On May 9, 1927, ceremonies marked the official transfer of the federal Parliamentfrom Melbourne to the new capital. Canberra lies on a plain at the foot of 6,200 foot spurs of the Australian Alps, enjoying warm summers and cool winters and receiving considerably less rainfall than the surrounding highlands." - <em>(from the Encyclopaedia Brittanica)</em><br>

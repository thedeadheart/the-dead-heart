<h3>The Somme</h3>
<p><em>"In a hospital ward on the <b>Somme</b>"</em> - Shakers and Movers (Blue Sky Mining)<br>
The Somme is an area of France that saw heavy losses on both sides in World War I. "The Germans were securely entrenched and strategically located when the British and French launched their frontal attack on  a 21 mile front north of the Somme River. Tremendous artillery barrages and aerial bombardments preceeded the infantry's 'going over the top' but they progressed slowly against the virtually impregnable German positions. The British sustained nearly 60,000 casualties, 20,000 dead, on  the first day of the attack. In mid-July a cavalry attack was destroyed by German machine guns. In September the British introduced their new weapon, the tank, which was terrifying but not yet particularly reliable. Improved fighting and scouting planes were more effective, and anti-aircraft guns were used for the first time. In October torrential rains turned the battlefield into an impassable sea of mud, and by mid-November the Allies had advance only 5 miles. Although the figures have been much disputed, the casualties from the First Battle of the Somme amounted to roughly 650,000 German, 195,000 French and 420,000 British.<br>

<h2>Using The Atlas</h2>

<p>Simply move the mouse pointer over the red dots to see the brief details for that area. Clicking on the dot will give more detailed information.<br>
Use the buttons along the top to choose which of the two maps to use, or to close the atlas completely.</p>

<p>The atlas has been tested with Netscape 3, 4 and 4.5 and IE4 (all on PC).</p>

<p><b>Not working properly?</b><br>
If you feel the atlas is not functioning properly (i.e. you get JavaScript
errors) please do not hesitate to get in touch with <a
    href="/contact/contact.php">The Dead Heart</a>. The same advice applies if the data regarding locations is inaccurate!</p>

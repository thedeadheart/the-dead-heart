<a name=a><h3>Alice Springs</h3>
<em>"In Redfern as there is in <b>Alice</b>"</em> - Warakurna (Diesel and Dust)<br>
<em>"Darwin down to <b>Alice Springs"</b></em> - Kosciuszko (Red Sails in the Sunset)<br>
Probably one of the most famous towns in Australia, as far as the rest of the world is concerned, Alice Springs is often considered to be "next door" to Uluru (Ayer's Rock), but is actually quite a distance away. Alice is one of the biggest population centres in the centre of Australia.<br>

<a name=b><h3>Brisbane</h3>
<em>"20 hours to <b>Brisbane</b> on a night prowl play,<br>20 hours to Brisbane... Where's Brisbane...?"</em> - Koala Sprint (Head Injuries)<br>
"Brisbane is the capital of the state of Queensland, lying near it's southeast corner, and is the third largest city in Australia. The site was selected in 1824 by the explorer, John Oxley, and was named after Sir Thomas M. Brisbane, a governor of New South Wales, who sent a party from Sydney the following year to settle the area. It was probably mentioned by Midnight Oil due to it's favourable weather and close proximity to good surfing beaches." - <em>(from the Encyclopaedia Brittanica)</em><br>

<a name=c><h3>Broken Hill</h3>
<em>"...you even stole our dingo in <b>Broken Hill</b>..."</em> - Michael Lippold's liner notes from Scream in Blue - Live.<br>
"Broken Hill is a mining city in west-central New South Wales. It lies on the eastern flank of the Main Barrier Range, 30 miles east of the South Australian border. Known as the Silver City, it is situated on one of the world's richest deposits of silver, lead and zinc ores. The site, in a hot and subarid region, was first visited in 1844 by Charles Sturt, who named the humpbacked range Broken Hill. The settlement was founded after the dicovery of lead and silver there in 1883. Mining operations were developed by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, Ltd. formed in 1885.<br>
Declared a municipality in 1888, Broken Hill was made a city in 1907. Broken Hill is a modern city with a university college associated with the Unviversity of New South Wales, hospitals, shops, and hotels. It is the base for a Royal Flying Doctor Service and a school of the air (which conducts school lessons via radio for outback children)." - <em>(from the Encyclopaedia Brittanica)</em><br>

<em>"A new crop of aerials in Dacca and <b>Canberra</b>"</em> - Tell Me The Truth (Earth and Sun and Moon)<br>
"Canberra is the federal capital of Australia, and is located in the northeastern section of the Asutralian Capital Territory (ACT). A small squatter' settlement of stockmne called Canberry, or Canbury (a derivation of an Aboriginal term menaing 'meeting place'), was made there as early as 1824. By 1836 the name had evolved to Canberra. Following the inauguration of the commonwealth in 1901, the site was chosen for the new capital in 1909, and the delineation of the ACT followed.<br>
A worldwide competition was launched in 1911 to find a design for a new federal capital, and the winning plan was submitted by the US architect Walter Burley Griffin. Construction began in 1913 but was interrupted by World War I. On May 9, 1927, ceremonies marked the official transfer of the federal Parliamentfrom Melbourne to the new capital. Canberra lies on a plain at the foot of 6,200 foot spurs of the Australian Alps, enjoying warm summers and cool winters and receiving considerably less rainfall than the surrounding highlands." - <em>(from the Encyclopaedia Brittanica)</em><br>

<em>"<b>Darwin</b> down to Alice Springs"</em> - Kosciuszko (Red Sails in the Sunset)<br>
<em>"We'll be staying at the Roma Bar"</em> - Truganini (Earth and Sun and Moon)<br>
"Darwin - a city with a population of around 55,000, average age 25. A city in which, in the depths of winter, you can sit on the beach at sunset, watching an iridescent orange ball of light sinking into the blue waters of Fanny Bay. And not feel cold. Where you can stretch beneath palmtrees watching wedge tails, kites and hawkes drift on the breeze, soaring high on the strength of an unseen thermal with the mere twitch of a wingtip. Where, on a winter's evening, you can wander down to the Botanic Gardens in shorts and a singlet with an armful of beer and join people sitting around..." <em>(from Strict Rules by Andrew McMillan)</em><br>
The <em>Roma Bar</em> is not (as originally stated here) in Roma, Queensland, but is in fact in Cavenagh Street, Darwin. I am reliably informed this by Andrew McMillan - "hence the monsoon reference" he says!

"Hobart is the largest city, chief port and capital of Tasmania. Located in the southeastern corner of the state the city ranges along steep foothills with Mt Wellington in the near background.It is Austalia's most southerly city. The British navigator George Bass explored the estuary in 1798 and was much impressed with the setting. Five years later the governor of New South Wales dispatched a lieutenant to establish a settlement at Ridson Cove. It was named Hobart Town after Robert Hobart, the secretary of state for the colonies. In 1804 the settlement was moved to the city's present site, Sullivan Cove. It was gazetted as a city in 1842 and a municipality in 1852. The municipality became part of the city in 1857." - <em>(from the Encyclopaedia Brittanica)</em><br>

Kakadu National Park is in the Northern Territory, Australia, established in 1979 and expanded in 1984 and 1987. It is located about 200 km east of Darwin. There are three main landscape regions—woodlands, which cover the largest area; rocky sandstone uplands in the south and east, rising to 450 km (280 mi) above the plains; and floodplains in the north. The park takes its name from the Aboriginal inhabitants, the Gagudju people, who trace their ancestry back at least 50,000 years. One thousand Aboriginal rock painting sites have been identified so far in the park; some of the paintings date from 35,000 years ago. Kakadu is an internationally important wetland and one of several sites in Australia inscribed on the World Heritage List.<br>

The settlement began as an out-station but quickly grew to become the nucleus of a spread of smaller out-stations. Midnight Oil visited Kintore on their Black Fella White fella tour of the outback in 1986.<br>

Mallee is also an agricultural region in the state of Victoria, producing most of it's wheat. It is a semi-arid area btween the Wimmera and Murray rivers.<br>
Note:- although the atlas entry for Mallee has been added, it has come to light that there is in a <b>mallee</b> which is a type of scubland vegetation of euclaypt species - this could be the mallee plains referred to in the song. (Mallee comes from an Aboriginal term for species of eucalypt)<br>

<a name=o><h3>Maralinga</h3>
<em><b>Maralinga</b></em> - Maralinga (10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1)<br>
In the 1940's and 50's, the English continued atomic bomb tests in South Australia. These were performed in appalling conditions with virtually no regard to safety, the environment or the indigenous peoples who considered the area to be a part of their sacred homelands. The site of the tests was Maralinga, which is named after the indigeneous tribe. Recently, the UK government agreed to pay compensation for the devastation it wrought upon the area, which is still uninhabitable. <em>(excerpt from Oilbase (compiled by Brian Perry))</em><br>

<a name=n><h3>Norfolk Island</h3>
<em>"So farewell to the <b>Norfolk Island</b> pines"</em> - Dreamworld (Diesel and Dust)<br>
Norfolk Island island is a dependency of Australia in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, about 1496 km (about 930 mi) east of the country. Norfolk Island was sighted in 1774 by the English explorer Captain James Cook. It was a British penal colony from 1788 to 1814 and again from 1825 to 1855. Norfolk Island was separated from New South Wales and made an Australian territory in 1914. It has been extensively deforested - hence the concern for it's rainforest pines showed by the Oils.<br>

<a name=s><h3>Sydney</h3>
<em>"<b>Sydney</b>, where the nights are warm"</em> - Power and the Passion (10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,)<br>
Sydney is a city and major port in southeastern Australia, and the capital of New South Wales. The largest city in Australia, Sydney is centered on the southern shore of Port Jackson. 
Sydney is one of Australia's leading industrial, commercial, financial, and transportation centers. Several of the country's largest companies are headquartered in Sydney. Port Jackson, which is spanned by the graceful, single-steel-arch Sydney Harbour Bridge, is a favorite spot for yacht owners.<br>
British explorer and navigator Captain James Cook sighted and named Port Jackson in 1770. The first European settlement in Australia was established on the site of modern Sydney by Captain Arthur Phillip in 1788. He named it Sydney Cove, after the British home secretary, Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney. Most of the early inhabitants were convicts sent out from Great Britain, but increasing numbers of free settlers arrived during the first half of the 1800s as New South Wales was developed by sheep and cattle raisers and wheat farmers.<br>
As well as home to several million people, Sydney is also the home of Midnight Oil, where they began playing to clubs along the surfing beaches.<br>

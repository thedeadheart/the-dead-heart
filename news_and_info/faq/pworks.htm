<p><a name="1"><b>Who are Powderworkers?</b></a><br>
Powderworkers are subscribers to the Powderworks list.</p>

<p><b>How do I join Powderworks?</b><br>
There are three ways to access Powderworks - join the full list,
join the digest, or read the archives (<a
href="http://pat.appliedtheory.com/powderworks-archive/">http://pat.appliedtheory.com/powderworks-archive/</a>).</p>

<p><a name="2"><b>What is POWDERWORKS?</b></a><br>
Powderworks is an Internet mailing list devoted to the Australian
band, Midnight Oil. The name comes from Midnight Oil's original
record label.</p>

<p><b>How do I subscribe/unsubscribe/leave messages?</b><br>
Powderworks currently resides on a majordomo server at the
University of Colorado.<br>
To join (or leave) the list, please send a message (no subject)
to:<br>
MAJORDOMO@CS.COLORADO.EDU with the text: SUBSCRIBE POWDERWORKS or
UNSUBSCRIBE POWDERWORKS<br>
Alternatively, there is a digest version available. To receive
just the list digest (or cancel the digest), send a message (no
subject) to: MAJORDOMO@CS.COLORADO.EDU with the text: SUBSCRIBE
POWDERWORKS-DIGEST (or UNSUBSCRIBE POWDERWORKS-DIGEST)<br>
Once joined, all correspondence should be directed to the list's
address at: POWDERWORKS@CS.COLORADO.EDU<br>
Help on the list can be received by sending a HELP message to:
POWDERWORKS-REQUEST@COLORADO.EDU</p>

<p><b>Is this list moderated?</b><br>
Yes, as a necessary evil, this list is moderated. The Powderworks
mailing list prides itself on being a place where open,
intelligent conversations take place. Unfortunately, the net
being the beast that it is, perfection is not easily achieved.
Therefore to prevent flame wars and other list impurities, the
list is moderated. However, do not fear, this is not a blatant
act of net.censorship, but rather a protective measure installed
to quell overly childish messages. It also keeps out the much
hated net.advertisements and chain letters.</p>

<p><b>Who is/How do I contact the list moderator?</b><br>
The list moderator is Tim Hunter and he can be reached most
easily through the list owner address at:
POWDERWORKS-OWNER@CS.COLORADO.EDU If that does not work, try:
TIM@BOULDER.COLORADO.EDU</p>

<p><b>What does this list talk about?</b><br>
This list is a fairly open forum for discussion on all things
Midnight Oil. This is typically limited to new albums and live
shows, but often we go off on tangents such as the merits of
Greenpeace, arguments over clear-cutting forests, etc. These
tangents are generally related (and preferably restricted) to the
political and social views expressed by the band and their fans.
Occasionally, topics on other Australian bands arise, but for the
most part we discourage public/on-list discussion for those
topics (although you are sure to get participants for private
talks).</p>

<p><b>What is the volume of the list?</b><br>
Like any other music band mailing list, the volume depends on the
activity of the band, but in general the volume is low. When new
albums are released or when tour dates are announced (i.e
&quot;the busy periods&quot;), the volume is between 30-40
msg/day. During downtimes between albums, the volume may drop as
low as 0-5 msg/day. In addition, because the list is moderated,
there may be an occasional day or two delay in messages.</p>

<p><b>How big is the list?</b><br>
As of this FAQ, the list has approximately 450 members with only
about 20-30 of them being considered truly &quot;active&quot;.</p>

<p><b>What is Midnight Oil's involvement on the list?</b><br>
MO is aware of the list and they occasionally listen in, but they
are not active members. The list is not a way to contact the
band.</p>

<p><b>What is Midnight Oil currently doing?</b><br>
After taking a much deserved year long retreat between 1995 and
1996, the band has returned to the recording booth. They are
known to be currently in progress on some new songs, with a
tenative album release sometime in October or November.
Afterwards, it is rumored the band will immediately record a
second new album before launching a major tour to support both of
them.</p>

<p><b>What is the list's (and the band's) stance on live tape
trading?</b><br>
At best, this is a touchy subject. The band and many list members
are very protective when dealing with issues relating to artistic
rights, bootlegs in particular. The band does not currently
condone bootlegs for commerical or non-commercial purposes. Many
list members also support this view and for this reason the
posting of open requests for live tapes is discouraged. Those
wishing to discuss tape trades are requested to use private mail.</p>

<p><b>How can I get JPegs, GIFs, Guitar Tabs, any other files?</b><br>
As mentioned in question #11, OilBase is available through both
FTP and the WWW. In addition, there are various pictures, JPegs,
and other assorted files concerning Midnight Oil at those sites.
Refer back to question #11 for the list of Powderworks data
sites. The WWW pages may also contain links to additional sites.</p>

<p><b>Does the band have a home page?</b><br>
Yes. It is located at: <a href="http://www.midnightoil.com/">http://www.midnightoil.com/</a></p>

<p><strong>Why are the acronyms MOC, NMOC and SMOC used, and what
do they stand for?</strong><br>
This simple code was developed as a means of indicating relevance
in postings sent to the mailing list. The code is added to the
subject line of the message being sent. Thus the receiver can
decide not to read messages with a particular code.<br>
The codes are Midnight Oil Content, Non-MOC, and Some MOC. It is
advised that NMOC messages are kept to a minimum, and should have
some relevance.</p>

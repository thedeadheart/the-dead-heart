<h1>FAQs on This FAQ <a href="index.html"><IMG src="ic5.jpg" align=absmiddle width=50 height=50 border=0></A></h1>

<b>Who created this FAQ?</b><br>
This FAQ was created by <a href="nonband.htm#1">Maurice Kelly <img src="ic8-sm.jpg" align=absbottom width=18 height=18 border=0></a>, with large scale help from <a href="nonband.htm#2">Pugwall <img src="ic8-sm.jpg" align=absbottom width=18 height=18 border=0></a> (<a href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/students/gg/gga95jls/index.html">http://www.shef.ac.uk/students/gg/gga95jls/index.html</a>) and Diana Lindsey.<p>

<b>Why was the FAQ created?</b><br>
The FAQ was created due to the lack of an all-encompassing FAQ for Midnight Oil on the web. I decided that, due to the volume of repeated questions on the <a href="pworks.htm#2">Powderworks <img src="ic6-sm.jpg" align=absbottom width=18 height=18 border=0></a> mailing list, a better FAQ was needed.<p>

<b>When was this FAQ created?</b><br>
This FAQ was created initially in March 97, but the current version may be drastically different from that which was originally created!<p>

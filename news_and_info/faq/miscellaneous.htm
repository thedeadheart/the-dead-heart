<b>Where are Midnight Oil touring right now?</b><br>
To be honest this is not a question that this FAQ can cover. Or as Pugwall reckons... "Easy. Australia 90% of the time, rest of the world 10% of the time." The Dead Heart touring news page "The Oils Are Coming..." (<a href="/opinion/live/touring.htm">http://www.deadheart.org.uk/opinion/live/touring.htm</a>) should contain some information.<p>

<b>What is Strict Rules?</b><br>
Strict Rules was a travelogue written by Andrew MacMillan, when he joined the Oils for their Black Fella / White Fella tour of the outback in 1986. Excerpts from the novel can be found at the official Midnight Oil site at <a href="http://www.midnightoil.com">http://www.midnightoil.com</a><p>

<p><b>Who is Peter Gifford?</b><br>
Peter Gifford is one of the Oils old bass players who joined in
1981, and left in 1989. He can be seen driving a lorry in the
Beds are Burning video (with beard).</p>

<p><b>Why did Peter Gifford leave?</b><br>
Peter Gifford reportedly left as he was tired of the rigors of
touring.</p>

<p><a name="1"><b>Who is Andrew &quot;Bear&quot; James?</b><br>
Bear James is one of the Oils old bass players who was in the
band originally and was replaced by Peter Gifford.</a></p>

<p><b>Why did Andrew James leave?</b><br>
Andrew James left due to exhaustion after a tour. Apparently he
had a very good position in a banking corporation at the time.
The Oils were OK, but not really doing anything spectacular
career wise I guess, so it was a case of chosing which way was
best for his career in the long term. Probably not a bad call
with the multitudes of bands that flunk on the way to the top.
Bet he let out a healthy sized &quot;D'oh!&quot; around 1982
though :) <em>(Kev Yates)</em></p>

<p><b>Who are the bands' influences?</b><br>
The bands influences are said to include The Who, and they are
reputed to have begun playing Creedence Clearwater Revival
covers.</p>

<p><b>Who manages Midnight Oil?</b><br>
The band have been managed from the beginning by Gary Morris.</p>

<p><strong>Was Neil Murray ever in Midnight Oil?<br>
</strong>The book <em>&quot;Who's Who of Australian Rock&quot;</em>
cites Neil Murray as bass player for the Oils in 1978/79, but the
entry for the band in the same book, does not mention him. It is
believed that Murray may have stepped in on bass for a time when <a
href="band.htm#1">Andrew James</a> was ill, but that he was never
formally a band member</p>

<p>1) Neil Murray was a teacher before moving to the outback in
1980.<br>
2) He lived in Melbourne, not in Sydney.<br>
3) Neil Murray is not credited with anything on any release, and
I've never seen him mentioned in any articles dealing with the
bands history.<br>
4) He's never been a bass player as far as I know, except
occasionally at Warumpi Band shows when the bass player went
walkabout. He's never played bass on any of his own albums.<br>
5) Neil being a former Oil is not mentioned in either of the two
books about the Blackfella/Whitefella tour, Andrew McMillan's
&quot;Strict Rules&quot;, or Neil's own &quot;Sing For Me
Countryman&quot;. Surely something like that would have cracked a
mention somewhere in those books.</p>

<p><strong>Why did Peter Shave his head?</strong><br>
The story goes... A long-haired Pete and his brother were surfing
one day, taking pictures of each other in action. When they got
the pictures back, they were annoyed to find that there were
locks of wet hair obscuring some of the shots. Pete decided to
cut his hair, but when it was cut short he decided to go
completely bald.</p>

<p><b>Where did the props from the cover of </b><a
href="album_faq/species_deceases.htm#1"><b>Species Deceases <img
src="ic1-sm.jpg" align="absbottom" border="0" width="18"
height="18"></b></a><b> come from?</b><br>
According to the inlay booklet to SD, thanks is given to the
Victoria Museum, so in all probabilty, the props are really
museum exhibits.</p>

<p><b>Who painted the cover to </b><a
href="album_faq/red_sails_in_the_sunset.htm#1"><b>Red Sails in
the Sunset <img src="ic1-sm.jpg" align="absbottom" border="0"
width="18" height="18"></b></a><b>?</b><br>
The cover of RSITS was painted by a Japanese montage artist by
the name of Tsunehisa Kimura.</p>

<p><b>What is the picture in the centre pages of the </b><a
href="album_faq/diesel_and_dust.htm#1"><b>Diesel And Dust <img
src="ic1-sm.jpg" align="absbottom" border="0" width="18"
height="18"></b></a><b> CD booklet (also on the cover of Black
Fella/White Fella)?</b><br>
The picture was taken by Ken Duncan (who also shot the cover
photo). At his gallery the description behind the shot is
&quot;Sliding Rock, Yirrkala, NT&quot;.</p>

<p><b>Where did the Sprint logo originate?</b><br>
The Sprint logo probably originated from the drawing inside the <a
href="album_faq/midnight_oil.htm#1">Midnight Oil <img
src="ic1-sm.jpg" align="absbottom" border="0" width="18"
height="18"></a> album. It portrays Peter Garrett with his hand
outstretched in the fashion of the logo - but it is not clear if
the logo was taken from this, or if the logo was added to the
drawing.</p>

<p><b>What is the fish on the cover of Breathe?</b><br>
The fish on <a href="album_faq/breathe.htm#1">Breathe <img
src="ic1-sm.jpg" align="absbottom" border="0" width="18"
height="18"></a> is a deep sea Angler Fish, found near the bottom
of deep ocean trenches. The protrusion from it's head is it's
illumination so that it can catch it's prey.</p>

<p><b>Was the back sleeve photo on </b><a
href="album_faq/head_injuries.htm#1"><b>Head Injuries <img
src="ic1-sm.jpg" align="absbottom" border="0" width="18"
height="18"></b></a><b> set up?</b><br>
Probably. Given the Oils dislike of the corporate record
companies, this photo was probably set up as a jibe at major
labels.</p>

<p><b>Who is who in the </b><a
href="album_faq/midnight_oil.htm#1"><b>Midnight Oil <img
src="ic1-sm.jpg" align="absbottom" border="0" width="18"
height="18"></b></a><b> album liner drawings?</b><br>
Clockwise from bottom left - Martin Rotsey, Peter Garrett, Rob
Hirst, Jim Moginie, <a href="band.htm#1">Andrew James <img
src="ic7-sm.jpg" align="absbottom" border="0" width="18"
height="18"></a>. (Note that I'm not too sure about Martin and
Jim, but this is probably correct as Martin is usually a strat
man, whereas Jim would play the Gibson.)</p>

<p><strong>Who took the photo for the cover of Diesel and Dust?<br>
</strong>This photo was taken by <a
href="http://www.kenduncan.com">Ken Duncan</a>, an Australian
photgrapher, who is becoming famous for his
&quot;panographic&quot; photos. As well as this photo he also
took the back cover photo, and the centre page photo. His photos
were also featured in the video to One Country.</p>

<p><strong>Where was the &quot;windmill photo&quot; taken (back
cover of </strong><a href="album_faq/blue_sky_mining.htm"><strong>Blue
Sky Mining <img src="ic1-sm.jpg" align="absbottom" border="0"
width="18" height="18"></strong></a><strong>, cover of Blue Sky
Mine single)?</strong><br>
This photo was taken by <a href="http://northpix.com/index.html">North
Sullivan</a>. The photo was taken outside of Palm Springs,
California. The band had a design company approach North, who
consented to allow the photo to be used, after having seen it in
his portfolio.</p>

<p><strong>How was the cover photo of Blue Sky Mining created?</strong><br>
This cover shot was taken by <a
href="http://www.gdeichmann.com/index.htm">Gunther Deichmann</a>.
There has been speculation as to how the lightening strike was
captured (some believe that the lightning was a computer aided
addition). I contacted Gunther, and this was what he had to offer
as an explanation...<br>
<em>&quot;The image of the cover of Midnight Oil's Blue Sky
Mining was created inside the camera and it is composed out of 2
images the lightning as the background &amp; the cracked earth as
foreground.&quot;</em></p>

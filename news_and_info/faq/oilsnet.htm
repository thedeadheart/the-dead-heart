<b>How can I find out x (x= discography, lyrics, tour dates,
etc.)</b><br>
OilBase is a large and growing collection of information about
the band. It began as a small discography written by Powderworker
Shane Johns and grew quickly from there. In the spring of 1994,
he dug up a bunch of old magazines and flyers and created a live
show register. <a href="nonband.htm#4">Brian Perry <img
src="ic8-sm.jpg" align="absbottom" border="0" width="18"
height="18"></a> combined those two lists and added most of the
known lyrics to formally create OilBase (the idea and name were
derived from the Grateful Dead database, Deadbase). Today, it
contains not only the discography, live show register and lyrics
but numerous other facts and FAQs about the band.<br>
The most recent version of the database is v4.0 which was
released in October 1994. The format of the database is a book
with 260 pages of pure text (ascii) with hard headers and form
feeds suitable for immediate printing. The database is available
through both FTP and the web.<br>

<p><b>Why is there no Midnight Oil newsgroup?</b><br>
This question was raised last year on the Powderworks list, and
the general consensus was that a Midnight Oil newsgroup is
unnecessary. The mailing list serves the purpose of a newsgroup
equally well, and it is generally agreed that more people have
access to e-mail than to newsgroups.</p>

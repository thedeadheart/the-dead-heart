<p><strong>What are the origins of the Powderworks label?</strong><br>
Powderworks was a label formed by the oils, but it was actually
run by some other guy. Basically 7 records were distributors,
like Festival or CBS at the time. Powderworks distributed through
7 'cause they were the only &quot;Australian owned&quot;
distributor - Festival sort of was, it was owned by Rupert 'I
used to be an Aussie' Murdoch. 7 never had significant success
&amp; went broke in the late 1970s. Powderworks, which basically
released records that were self-funded (i.e.the label didn't
actually have money itself, self-financed bands were released on
it) then moved to a distribution deal with RCA. Again the bands
had to do all the actual promo work themselves, the label existed
as a release format, but not much else. As pointed out, it did
fade in the mid-1980s. It did ironically make some money out of
the Oils first 'chart' success, being 'Bird Noises' which was
reasonably successful at the time...</p>

<p><a name="1"><strong>Who recorded the song Land?</strong></a><br>
The song Land was recorded by some of the members of Midnight
Oil, along with members of Hothouse Flowers and The Tragically
Hip.</p>

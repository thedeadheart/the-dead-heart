<a name=2><b>Why is Wedding Cake Island an instrumental?</b><br>
WCI was originally a travelogue about the coast written by Peter Garrett, but the lyrics were judged as too libellous to publish, so the track was put out as an instrumental (with the exception of a mumble at the end). It is rumoured that only Rob Hirst still has a copy of the original recording with lyrics.<p>

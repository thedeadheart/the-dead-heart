<p><a name="1"><b>What is 20,000 Watt RSL?</b></a><br>
RSL is the bands 10th album. Rather than a new studio album, RSL
is actually a Midnight Oil Collection - a term preferred by Peter
Garrett over &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. It features 16 of the
bands' favourite songs, and 2 new tracks - White Skin Black Heart
and What Goes On.</p>

<p><b>Who produced 20,000 Watt RSL?</b><br>
RSL was produced by a number of different producers.</p>

<p><b>When was 20,000 Watt RSL released?</b><br>
RSL was released in Oct/Nov 1997.</p>

<p><b>What singles were released from 20,000 Watt RSL?</b><br>
White Skin Black Heart was released.</p>

<p><b>Where did the title 20,000 Watt RSL come from?</b><br>
RSL stands for the Returned Services League, an Australian
institution not dissimilar to the Royal British Legion. The term
20,000 Watts is probably related to noise output from amplifiers
(20,000 is no doubt and exaggeration).</p>

<p><strong>Will White Skin Black Heart and What Goes On appear on
another album?<br>
</strong>Yes, both these songs are due to appear on the
forthcoming Oils album <a href="redneck_wonderland.htm">Redneck
Wonderland <img src="../ic1-sm.jpg" align="absbottom" border="0"
width="18" height="18"></a>.</p>

<p><strong>What is different about the version of King of the
Mountain on RSL?<br>
</strong>It is the 7&quot; remix from the 12&quot; single done by
<a href="../producer.htm#3">Nick Launay <img src="../ic2-sm.jpg"
align="absbottom" border="0" width="18" height="18"></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Was there a b-sides promo given away at the time of
the release of 20,000 Watt RSL?<br>
</strong>Yes, there was a b-sides disc compiled and distributed
to radio stations in Oz and the US. It is supposedly limited to
500 copies and was only to be given away as radio competition
prize. The track list was...<br>
You May Not Be Released<br>
Arctic World<br>
Knifes Edge<br>
I'm The Cure<br>
Shakers And Movers<br>
Power And The Passion (Special Version)<br>
Wharf Rat<br>
Bushfire<br>
Kolele Mai<br>
Ships of Freedom<br>
Gravel Rash<br>
I See You<br>
<br>
However there may be another b-sides disc out there with a
slightly different track listing (only 8 songs).<br>
Also, the Special Version of Power and the Passion may also be
known as Glitch Baby Glitch.</p>

<p><strong>What videos were omitted from the 20,000 Watt RSL
Visual Collection?</strong><br>
The video for the Sometimes - Live single (released for <a
href="scream_in_blue.htm#1">Scream In Blue - Live <img
src="../ic1-sm.jpg" align="absbottom" border="0" width="18"

video for Truganini (released for <a
href="earth_and_sun_and_moon.htm#1">Earth And Sun And Moon <img
src="../ic1-sm.jpg" align="absbottom" border="0" width="18"
height="18"></a>). A note to make is the lack of the <a
href="miscellaneous.htm#1">Land <img src="../ic1-sm.jpg"
align="absbottom" border="0" width="18" height="18"></a> video,
as it is credited in the copyright details of the video.</p>

<p><strong>Who wrote the essay in the liner notes?</strong><br>

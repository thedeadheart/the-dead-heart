<p><b>When was Breathe released?</b><br>
Breathe was released on 7th October 1996 (15/10 in the US).</p>

<p><b>Where was Breathe recorded?</b><br>
Breathe was recorded in Sydney and New Orleans.</p>

<p><b>Where did the title Breathe come from?</b><br>
Suggested (though not sure if by the band) that it was a
reference to the attitude of the band at the time of recording.</p>

<p><b>What singles were released from Breathe?</b><br>
To date two singles have been released in Australia - Underwater,
and Surf's Up Tonight, and worldwide only Underwater has been
released.</p>

<p><b>Was there a collectors edition of Breathe released (in a
cardboard case)?</b><br>
The European and Australian versions of Breathe were both
released in a cardboard case, whereas the US version was a
standard jewel case. Some cardboard cases were labelled
&quot;Limited Edition&quot; but, as a Powderworker pointed out,
how limited is it if it's available across two continents?</p>

<p><strong>Was Breathe a commercial failure?<br>
</strong>Breathe was a slight departure from the Oils in that it
was a quieter album than Earth and Sun and Moon. It certainly
didn't sell as well as some previous albums, but it was still an
excellent recording.</p>

Originally from England, Martin got his first guitar at 12 (good age for starting), and met up with Rob when he was in Schwampy Moose. At uni he did part of an arts course, before leaving, and then joined up with the newly formed Oils. Originally he joined as a temporary replacement for bassist Andrew James, but when Bear came back Martin stayed on as a guitarist. Like Moginie, he's shy and quiet, but tends to lose his inhibitions through his guitar. The pic on the left is a typical performance posture of Martin. I feel that he's probably the most mysterious member of the band. Like Bones, he doesn't contribute as much to the song-writing, but is still an essential part of the bands make-up. (I guess you could call him the foundation then - okay, I know it was a bad joke!)</p>

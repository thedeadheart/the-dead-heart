As said above, Jim and Rob started playing together when they were fifteen. An ace guitarist, Jim is also a major contributor to the song-writing process. He's quite a shy person and I really don't know enough about Jim Moginie to do him justice, so I can only state the facts that he played guitar for Jenny Morris, and that he produced These Hands for Neil Murray (the infrequently mentioned other bassist).</p>

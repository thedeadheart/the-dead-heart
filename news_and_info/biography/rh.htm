<p><span class="name">Rob Hirst</span><br>
<span class="inst">Drums, Vox</span><br>
Rob started drumming when he was 7, and got his first kit at 15. He and Jim began playing together, and formed the band known as Schwampy Moose. His major musical influence appears to be The Who. Rob is a member of another band (a side project) with two albums and a number of singles to their credit (co-produced by Rob), the band being Ghostwriters. Unfortunately their material has not been globally released, but that may change. He also worked with Charlie McMahon (didge player) of Gondwanaland Project, and co-wrote the Australian Olympic song for 1988.</p>

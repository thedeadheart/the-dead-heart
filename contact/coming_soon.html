    <b>Classic Oils Gigs</b><br>
    A section a long time in planning but has been taking a long time to 
    actually coming into being. Basically this is going to be a bunch of 
    feature articles about those classic gigs that you hear other Oils fans 
    talking about so enthusiastically. (The idea is that you can read up on 
    said gigs, and pretend you were at them too!) Essentially the features 
    will cover setlists, reviews of the concerts, the motives behind them, 
    and discussion of exactly why the gigs are considered classics.<br>
    <b>Current ETA:</b> Jan 2004

    <b>Bigger, Better Discography</b><br>
    The current discography looks nice, and serves it's purpose reasonably 
    well, but following the creation of the song database (see above), it was 
    felt that more could be done with the full discography. The current plan 
    is to make it fully searchable, with individual entries for every version 
    of a release. At present, the discography for a particular release covers 
    all versions (formats and national releases). The new discography will have 
    detailed information within a release - country, codes, packaging). Links 
    out to the song database will provide even more detailed information.<br>
    <b>Current ETA:</b> Strangely enough this is actually here - try looking
    at <a href="/news_and_info/release_database/">this</a>. The framework is
    there, but the ongoing project is really getting the data into it.

    <b>Updates To Song Database</b><br>
    There is an ongoing project to revamp the 
    <a href="/news_and_info/songdb/">song database</a> taking more account of
    the different versions of the songs out there. The structural changes have
    mostly been made, but (as with the Release Database) there is a
    substantial amount of work to be done on the actual data going into the
    database.<br>
    <b>Current ETA:</b> Ongoing

<p>You have either stumbled across or deliberately entered the Dead Heart Midnight Oil homepage. Either way, thanks for dropping by! Whether you're a long-time fan of the band, a new fan looking for further information, or someone who's just browsed in, I'm sure you'll find something of interest. There's background on the band, opinions, facts, images and more. I hope you find everything you could possibly want, and if you can't, then drop me a line to let me know what you want.</p>

<p>I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you for visiting The Dead Heart in what is now it's 3rd year of existence! I'm pleased to be able to say that the site has continually improved, and is now probably the biggest collection of Oils information on the Net! The last count revealed 670 pages of HTML, 552 images, and a total of 8.65 Mbs of data! So if you're looking for info on the Oils, you're looking in the right place! Again thanks for visiting, and I hope you decide to come back!</p>

There is stuff in The Dead Heart which probably shouldn't be used without permission. In that case if you are in a position to do so - grant it. If anyone from the band, the bands' management, label, or associated owners of any copyrighted material objects to anything on this site, then regard this as my application for permission. If I was able to contact the band I would have attempted to obtain permission long ago.</p>

    <h1>About The List</h1>

    <p>
    Powderworks has been running for quite a long time now. It is a usually 
    unmoderated list that deals with Midnight Oil, the band members side 
    projects, and related issues (within reason). The band are not present on 
    the list, although they are aware of its existence. List members are 
    located across the world with high concentrations in the US and Australia.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    While the list is generally unmoderated, the administrator (Tim Hunter) 
    does attempt to read every posting. If the subject matter is no longer 
    on the right subject or discussion is getting too heated, he will 
    moderate the list for a short period, and bounce any unsuitable posts 
    (you have been warned!).
    </p>

    <p>
    Newcomers are always welcome, but it is advised that before posting they 
    consult both the 
    <a href="/news_and_info/faq/pworks.htm">Powderworks FAQ</a> for list 
    specific questions and the 
    <a href="/news_and_info/faq/index.html">Midnight Oil FAQ</a> here at The 
    Dead Heart for Oils questions in general. This will save on repetitive 
    posting, and could be the difference between making a graceful entry to 
    Powderworks (appreciated) or crashing in with your feet in your mouth 
    (not so much appreciated!). (Note that the Powderworks FAQ is available 
    both here at The Dead Heart, and will be mailed to you when you join up!)

          Yeah it would be good to have more full on stuff. I people are wanting to 
          use my instrumentals then I may be able to rerecord them and get them sounding 
          a bit better. I bought a bass since and those old songs don't have any bass 
          on them, plus they were possibly a bit rushed. Anyway, whatever is cool 
          with me. I'll let you know if and when I get a band recording of a song.

          (Phillip E. Seiden) TRIBUTE LINER NOTES for Back on the Borderline and Sins 
          of Omission. Recorded in my basement - Detroit (Clawson), Michigan, Midwestern 
          USA Back On The Borderline - This is the first Oils tune I remember hearing... 
          at a dorm party sometime around late '83. I got hit in the forehead with 
          a Fosters OILCAN at that same party... and I still have the scar. When I 
          first heard about this Tribute I knew I'd have to do a version. Started 
          in February of '98, this song has been through 3 versions since... disk 
          errors, crashes, corrupted files, it's a wonder I ever got it done. Redneck 
          Wonderland had a huge influence on my approach to the final version. Arrangement: 
          Synthesizer bass, guitar, guitar feedback, many FX boxes, fuzzy vocals (me), 
          Yamaha drum machine, acoustic snare, and LOTS of loops & editing. I used 
          Rob's "stick hit/whoop" from the original for the intro rhythm. Sins of 
          Omission - I'm a big fan of musical contrasts - the rawness of Breath was 
          a refreshing break from album after album of stunning production - RSITS, 
          D&D, BSM, ESM. In the early-mid 80s I played guitar in a couple of bands 
          (BOB / Tool & Die) that did a lot of feedback/dirge/wall-of-sound/industrial 
          surf-type tunes. Sins (especially the live version on 20,000 WSRL video) 
          really appeals to the primal-scream guitar player in me. I wanted to contrast 
          Sins' grungy lurching feel with some electronica elements & see what happened. 
          Recorded entirely the last week of 1999. Vocals are courtesy of an old band-mate, 
          Stefan Keydel--bassist & lead vocalist from the above-mentioned groups. 
          I wound up using my old guitar tuner for the harmonica effects. Arrangement: 
          LOTS of midi synths, synthesizer bass, guitar, guitar feedback, FX stomp 
          boxes, acoustic snare, vocals (Stefan Keydel), and LOTS of editing. Instruments: 
          SONY VAIO PC with Cakewalk & other misc. music software, EVENT Electronics 
          DARLA digital audio card, NUMARK DJ mixer, Radio Shack vocal microphone, 
          AudioTechnica stereo microphone, Gibson SG guitar, 10 or 15 FX stomp boxes, 
          Fender Amp, KORG MonoPoly Synthesizer, homemade e-bow thingy, Yamaha RX-8 
          drum machine, Ludwig snare drum, and a pair of Midnight Oil drumsticks (courtesy 
          of the Mercury Lounge).</font></p>

          A friend sent me your latest e-mail seeking musical contributions for your 
          Oil Tribute CD. Am I too late, or would you like to consider my cover of 
          their song "Dead Heart?" I played all the musical instruments myself including 
          3 guitars, (2 accoustic and one electric, which were recorded at alternate 
          speeds in matching keys) and a keyboard synth (for drums, bass, percussion, 
          chimes, trombone and string effects) Plus vocals. Recorded and mixed right

          Same Yamaha 4-track & Korg effects unit, but all the instruments except 
          the harmonica (played live, by me!) were provided by my Roland RD-600 keyboard,

          O-beat: Made with Protracker on my Amiga 1200. Consists of various Oils 
          samples (+ some other samples) that I sampled myself from my CDs. Recorded/Made 
          in my room at home, Älvkarleby, Sweden. Warakurna: I play drums, acoustic 
          guitar and sing lead vocals. I am not sure exactly what Julian added to 
          it (I haven't heard the finished song yet!) but he was meant to add bass-guitar, 
          guitar and backup vocals. I hope he lets you know about what he added. Drums 
          recorded in Musikhuset, Gävle, Sweden. Guitar and vocals recorded in my 
          room, Älvkarleby, Sweden. Recorded with my porta, don't remember it's name 
          and model at the moment but it's the same one as I used for Whoah. :-) magnus.holmgren@mbox201.swipnet.se

This is the third installment of the Powderworks tribute series. We have come a long way since Scott Peretta's original vision of those fans on the Powderworks mailing list to sharing their oily creations with each other. This being the latest edition happens to be coming out at a time of heightened interest in the OILS. A new album is out, the list is buzzing, and new shows are on the horizon, well, for those in Australia anyway. I want to start out by thanking all those who have had a hand in this project since the start. Most recently, Phil Seiden has done a bunch of work hosting a website for this project and has been great to work with as well. Artwork for this volume is the sole work of Barbie Edwards who had a fun idea for cover art and produced some great original ideas.  Of course the project is only possible because of the talent and spirit of those Powderworkers covering these great tunes, as long as they continue producing these great renditions we'll just have to keep making them available for our select group of fans!</font></p>

1 – <a name="01"><b>Redneck Wonderland</b></a><br>
***2nd ever Powderworks International Collaboration<br>
Jeff Scott (Geraldton Western Australia) lead vocals, guitar, guitar effects, synthesizer/keyboards, bass.<br>
I recorded the tracks on my old Yamaha MT120 4-track, then transferred them onto the PC using CoolEdit 2000 with the 4-track add-on. For the gear-heads out there, I used a Squire Strat electric guitar, a Blueridge 12 string acoustic, a Peavey SD-GR bass, Yamaha PSR-32 and PSR-75 keyboards, and my very own voice on these tracks. I recorded electric guitars, bass, keyboards and vocals onto about seven separate tracks, then put those tracks on a CD and sent them to Phil in the US.<br>
Phil Seiden (Clawson, Michigan, USA—) backing vocals, drum & rhythm loops, guitar, feedback, didgeridoo & other misc. sample loops, production.<br>
Soon after finishing my tracks for the last tribute I knew I wanted to collaborate with another Powderworker on a song from Redneck Wonderland. I realized that Jeff Scott had contributed a ton of RW tabs to our little 
musical community, and knew his multi-instrumental skills would help give this next project the dense feel appropriate to the material. We both recorded our instrumental tracks for the song using the original CD for 
reference. Jeff sent me a CD with his recorded takes (Jeff in one channel playing along with the MO version in the other channel) and I synced everything up using Sound Forge and ACID on my laptop. My guess is there's 
somewhere between 12 and 15 layers of guitar in the song alone, so that gives you an idea of the kind of craziness these new musical software packages let you get away with.

10 & 11 – <a name="10"><b>Ships of Freedom & Runaway Bay</b></a><br>
By Julian Shaw a.k.a. Pugwall<br>
Both recorded at home on a Fostex 4-track. Zoom supplied the drum machine and the effects units (for vocal, acoustic, bass and electric), Behringer the mixing desk, Yamaha the electric, Fender the acoustic, Washburn the bass, Casio the keyboard and Rode the mike.  The whole process of practicing, programming and recording took me less than 24 hours. I'm especially pleased with the way that Ships sounds. Most of it was done in one take and sounds a little sloppy for that. However, I think this makes it sound a little more like the Oils would play it live - with a lot of energy!  Plug: you can find out more about my band at <a href="http://www.cromeyellow.co.uk/">www.cromeyellow.co.uk</a> or e-mail me at 
<a href="mailto:julian@cromeyellow.co.uk">julian@cromeyellow.co.uk</a>
</p>

<p>
12 – <a name="12"><b>Concrete</b></a><br>
Jeff Scott (Australia)<br>
I recorded this version of Concrete in about half an hour. Just two 12-string acoustic guitar tracks and three vocal tracks. This was the song Phil and I originally wanted to do, but neither of us could work out how to play all of it! I toyed with the idea of calling this track "Plastic" 'cos it's like Concrete only softer.
</p>

<p>
13 – <a name="13"><b>Koala Sprint</b></a><br>
Jonathan Hart (Calgary, Alberta, Canada)<br>
12-string Yamaha acoustic guitar.<br>
Ibanez X-series bass guitar played through a Peavey Express 112 guitar amp.<br>
Recorded through an AKG D60S microphone on my Panasonic portable stereo.
</p>

<p>
14 – <a name="14"><b>Ghosties Medley</b></a><br>
Jeff Scott (Australia)<br>
This was the first thing I recorded for this volume, and I spent quite a long time on it. (That is, a lot of time passed between starting and finishing it, but the birth of my son in the middle meant that quite a few Ghosties song, but basically I couldn't decide which one to do. So I came up with this medley, which I think works quite well as a summary of the first two Ghosties albums.

          Well, first of all the project's original idea was not mine, it was 
          from fellow powderworker Scott Peretta, who can be heard on quite a 
          few tracks on volume 1. He had the idea, passed it to me as someone 
          having the means to produce the discs before cdrs became the norm. We 
          discussed the project in person in Toronto on the Breathe tour whereas 
          I took the idea and ran with it, his original tracks being my main thrust 
          to get enough songs together to at least get one volume out there, never 
          thinking there would be a second, or third, or ????. Anyway, it all 
          started there and the contributors on the list with obviously a hell 
          of a lot of talent and passion for the band of all bands make it work, 
          I only look on myself as the facilitator. I am the OILMAN, not by self 
          proclamation, but rather by the lore of family, friends, and listees 
          :)</font></p>
